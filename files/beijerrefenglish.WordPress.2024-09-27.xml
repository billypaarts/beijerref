		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>- Net sales increased by 53 per cent to SEK 2,562.1M (1,679.8). The increase is due to the acquisition of Carrier ARW.

- Operating profit amounted to SEK 128.6M (147.3). Including one-time gains of SEK 53.2M, operating profit was SEK 200.5 in 2008.

- Profit after tax amounted to SEK 87.5M (106.0). Including one-time gains of SEK 53.2M, profit after tax was SEK 159.2M in 2008. 

- Profit per share amounted to SEK 4.44 (8.55). Including one-time gains, profit per share was SEK 12.84 in 2008.

SALES
The G &amp; L Beijer Group was affected by the continued general negative economic trend during the first half of the year. Consolidated sales for the first six months rose by 53 per cent to SEK 2,562.1M (1,679.8). The increase is explained by the acquisition of Carrier ARW which is included in G &amp; L Beijer’s accounts from 1 February 2009. The Group’s underlying sales, excluding the acquisition, were lower compared with the previous year. In addition, demand during the first half of 2008 was on an historically high level. Sales for the second quarter increased by 58 per cent to SEK 1,454.6M (923.0).

THE BEIJER REF BUSINESS AREA’S sales for the first six months of the year increased by 71 per cent to SEK 2,292.7M (1,343.7). The increase is explained by the acquisition of Carrier ARW. In spite of the financial crisis, sales in the Nordic markets as well as in Switzerland and South Africa were relatively stable. Holland and Poland reported a slightly less favourable development and the other East European countries as well as Italy, France and Spain reported continued weak development. Sales for comparable units fell by seven per cent. Currency effects affected sales positively by approximately 10 per cent. Sales for the acquired operations, which were included in February-June, amounted to SEK 1,046M. Sales for the second quarter rose by 78 per cent to SEK 1,325.3M (745.0). Sales for the acquired operations amounted to SEK 656M for the second quarter.     

THE BEIJER TECH BUSINESS AREA’S sales amounted to SEK 269.4M (336.1). The fall is due to the continued slowdown in demand within the manufacturing industry where Beijer Tech’s principal customers are found. Sales for the second quarter amounted to SEK 129.2M (178.0).

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today, 24 April 2009, G &amp; L Beijer AB (publ) held its Annual Meeting of shareholders for the 2008 financial year. The Annual Meeting adopted the profit and loss account and balance sheet for the parent company and the Group. The Board Members and the Managing Director were discharged from liability. The Annual Meeting endorsed the Board of Directors’ proposal for a dividend of SEK 6.00 per share and 29 April 2009 as the record day. The dividend is expected to be remitted by Euroclear on 5 May 2009. <br />
<br />
In his speech at the Annual Meeting, the Managing Director of G &amp; L Beijer, Joen Magnusson, gave an account of the company’s operations during 2008 and for the first quarter of 2009.  <br />
<br />
In addition, the Annual Meeting of shareholders passed the following resolutions: <br />
<br />
- that the lawyer Johan Sigeman is appointed Chairman of the Annual Meeting. <br />
- that the number of Board Members will be seven and that no Deputy Board Members will be elected.<br />
- that the Directors’ fees will be SEK 1,415,000. The Chairman will receive SEK 340,000 and the Board Members who are not employed in the company will receive SEK 215,000 each. <br />
- that the remuneration of the Auditors will be paid in accordance with the submitted quotation.<br />
- that Peter Jessen Jürgensen, Poul Friis, Anne-Marie Pålsson, Bernt Ingman, Joen Magnusson, Philippe Delpech and William Striebe are re-elected as Board Members and that Peter Jessen Jürgensen is appointed Chairman of the Board. <br />
- that the Authorised Public Accountant Mikael Eriksson and the Authorised Public Accountant Lars Nilsson, both of  Öhrlings PricewaterhouseCoopers, Malmö, are re-elected for the term until the end of the Annual Meeting of shareholders to be held during the third financial year after the election of Auditors, i.e. year 2012. <br />
- that the company shall have an Election Committee consisting of one representative of each of the company’s three largest shareholders together with the Chairman of the Board. When the composition of the Election Committee is decided, the conditions on the last banking date in August 2009 shall determine who are the largest owners according to number of votes. If any of the three largest shareholders refrains from appointing a Member, the right shall be passed on to the owner who is next in size. The names of the Members, including the Chairman, and the shareholders who have appointed them shall be announced as soon as possible and not later than six months prior to the 2010 Annual Meeting of shareholders, when the following shall apply:<br />
• The Members of the Election Committee shall appoint the Chairman of the Election Committee who must not be a Board Member. <br />
• No special remuneration shall be paid for the work in the Election Committee.<br />
• A shareholder who has appointed a Member of the Election Committee may remove the Member and appoint a new Member and, when required, replace a Member who has left the Election Committee before the work has been completed. If a Member no longer represents one of the three largest owners, such a Member can resign, if the Election Committee finds it appropriate, and a replacement can be appointed by the owner who has by then become the third largest owner.<br />
• Changes in the composition of the Election Committee, if any, shall be announced as soon as they have been made. <br />
• The Election Committee shall work out proposals to be placed before the 2010 Annual Meeting of shareholders for resolutions on the following matters: (a) Chairman of the Annual Meeting of shareholders, (b) Board of Directors, (c) Chairman of the Board, (d) Directors’ fees, (e) remuneration of the company’s Auditors and (f) rules for the appointment of the Election Committee ahead of the 2011 Annual Meeting of shareholders.<br />
<br />
- that the guidelines proposed by the Board of Directors for the remuneration of and other terms of employment for senior executives are adopted as follows:<br />
• By senior executive is meant the Managing Director, the Chief Financial Officer and the Heads of the two business areas. <br />
• The remuneration shall consist of a fixed salary, a variable salary, a pension and other remuneration such as a company car. The total remuneration shall be on market terms and support the interest of the shareholders by enabling the company to attract and retain senior executives. <br />
• The fixed salary is renegotiated annually and takes into account the area of responsibility, competence, performance and experience of the individual. The variable part of the salary is based on qualitative and quantitative target fulfilment. The individual will receive a maximum amount equivalent to one months’ salary. On the maximum outcome, the total cost for the variable portion of the salary is estimated to amount to approximately SEK 1,200,000. <br />
• The Executive Management’s pension scheme is contribution-based. An amount equivalent to 26 per cent of the gross salary, including variable salary, is appropriated annually for the Managing Director, and to an amount of up to 24 per cent of the gross salary, including variable salary, for the other Members of the Executive Management.<br />
• Severance pay of not more than 24 months’ salary will be paid to the Managing Director. Severance pay to the other Members of the Executive Management varies and amounts to not more than 24 months’ salary including salary at notice. The Executive Management can give six months’ notice of termination. Notice of termination by the Managing Director or other senior executives does not trigger any severance pay.<br />
• The Board of Directors prepares matters of remuneration and other terms of employment for the Executive Management and the Board of Directors as a whole constitutes the Remuneration Committee. The Managing Director does not participate in the work.<br />
• The Board of Directors may abandon these guidelines if there are specific reasons for it in an individual case.<br />
<br />
- that the Articles of Association are amended in accordance with the Board of Directors’ proposal. It means that that Para 10, subpara one of the Articles of Association relating to the way of giving notice of a meeting of shareholders is changed as follows: ’’Notice shall be made through an advertisement in Post- och Inrikes Tidningar and on the company’s website. The fact that notice has been given shall be advertised in Dagens Industri.’’ The resolution regarding amendment to the Articles of Association was conditional on an amendment to the Companies Act’s (SFS 2005:551) rules relating to the way of giving notice having come into force, which means that the proposed wording of Para 10, subpara one of the Articles of Association is compatible with the Companies’ Act.<br />

• Profit per share amounted to SEK 1.46 (3.28). Including one-time gains, profit per share was SEK 7.58 in 2008.<br />

<br />
<br />
SALES<br />
The G &amp; L Beijer Group was affected by the negative economic trend during the first quarter. However, the effects were limited by Beijer’s high proportion of sales to the aftermarket. Consolidated sales for the period rose by 46 per cent to SEK 1,107.5M (756.8). The increase is explained by the acquisition of Carrier ARW which is included in G &amp; L Beijer’s accounts from 1 February 2009. However, the Group’s underlying sales, excluding the acquisition, are lower compared with the previous year. At the same time, the acquisition of Carrier ARW significantly strengthened the seasonal pattern with weak first and fourth quarters whilst the second and third quarters are strong. Demand during the first quarter of 2008 was on an historically high level. <br />
<br />
THE BEIJER REF BUSINESS AREA’S sales increased by 62 per cent to 967.4M (598.7) as a result of the acquisition of Carrier ARW. Demand in the different markets showed a disparate picture. The Nordic countries and Central Europe, especially Switzerland, were stable as was South Africa whilst Eastern Europe, Southern Europe and the United Kingdom were weak. Sales for comparable units fell by three per cent. Currency effects affected sales positively by eight per cent. Sales for the acquired units, which were included in February and March, amounted to SEK 390M.   <br />
<br />
THE BEIJER TECH BUSINESS AREA’S sales amounted to SEK 140.1M (158.1). The fall is explained by the slowdown in demand from Beijer Tech’s principal customers in the manufacturing industry. However, the business area’s broad product portfolio and customer base were stabilising factors and mitigated the fall in sales.   <br />

Item 13: The company shall have an Election Committee consisting of one representative of each of the company’s four largest shareholders together with the Chairman of the Board of Directors.

- Changes in the composition of the Election Committee, if any, shall be announced in public as soon as they have been made. <br />
- The Election Committee shall work out proposals to be placed before the Annual General Meeting of 2010 for resolutions on the following matters: (a) Chairman of the Annual General Meeting, (b) Board of Directors, (c) Chairman of the Board, (d) Directors’remuneration, (e) Auditor’s remuneration and (f) rules for the appointment of the Election Committee ahead of the Annual General Meeting of 2011.   <br />
 <br />
<br />
Item 14 – Resolution regarding guidelines for the remuneration of senior executives  <br />
The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting adopts guidelines for remuneration and other terms of employment for senior executives as follows. For this purpose, senior executive is defined as the Managing Director, the Chief Financial Officer and the Heads of the two business areas.<br />
<br />
The remuneration shall consist of a fixed salary, a variable salary, a pension and other remuneration such as a company car. The total remuneration shall be on market terms and support the interest of the shareholders by enabling the company to attract and retain senior executives.  <br />
<br />
The fixed salary is renegotiated annually and takes into account the area of responsibility, competence, performance and experience of the individual. The variable part of the salary is based on qualitative and quantitative target fulfilment. The individual will receive a maximum amount equivalent to one months’ salary. On the maximum outcome, the cost for the variable portion of the salary is estimated to amount to approximately SEK 1,200,000, in total. <br />
<br />
The Executive Management’s pension scheme is contribution-based. An amount equivalent to 26 per cent of the gross salary, including variable salary, is appropriated annually for the Managing Director, and to an amount of up to 24 per cent of the gross salary, including variable salary, for the other Members of the Executive Management. <br />
<br />
Severance pay of not more than 24 months’ salary will be paid to the Managing Director. Severance pay to the other Members of the Executive Management varies and amounts to no more than 24 months’ salary including salary upon notice. The Executive Management has a notice of termination of six months. Notice of termination by the Managing Director or other senior executives does not trigger any severance pay.<br />
<br />
The Board of Directors prepares matters of remuneration and other terms of employment for the Executive Management and the Board of Directors as a whole constitutes the Remuneration Committee. The Managing Director does not participate in the work. <br />
<br />
The Board of Directors may abandon these guidelines if there are specific reasons for it in an individual case.<br />
<br />
<br />
Item 15 – Resolution regarding amendment to the Articles of Association <br />
The Board of Directors proposes that Para 10, subpara one, line three of the Articles of Association regarding the means of convening the General Meetings to be amended as follows: Notice shall be made through an announcement in Post- och Inrikes Tidningar and on the company’s website. It shall be announced in Dagens Industri that notice of a General Meeting has been made. <br />
<br />
In addition, the Board of Directors proposes that the resolution by the Annual General Meeting regarding amendment to the Articles of Association shall be subject to an amendment of the Companies Act’s (SFS 2005:551) rules relating to the means of convening a General Meeting having come into force, which means that the proposed wording of Para 10, subpara one, line three of the Articles of Association is compatible with the Companies’ Act. <br />
<br />
The Annual Meeting’s decision to pass a resolution in accordance with the Board of Directors proposal will only be valid if it is supported by shareholders representing at least two thirds of the votes cast and the shares represented at the Annual General Meeting. <br />
 <br />
C. Available documents<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>- Net sales increased by seven per cent to SEK 3,356.6M (3,136.0).<br />
- Operating profit rose by 13 per cent to SEK 338.3M (298.4) including one-time gains of SEK 53.2M (5.9).  <br />
- Profit after tax increased to SEK 255.2M (212.5).  <br />
- Profit per share rose by 20 per cent to SEK 20.58 (17.11).<br />
- Profit per share excluding one-time gains amounted to SEK 16.29 (16.63).<br />
- The Board of Directors proposes a dividend of SEK 6.00 per share (6.00).<br />
<br />
- The acquisition of Carrier ARW was completed on 30 January 2009 and a directed non-cash issue to Carrier Corporation has been carried out.<br />
<br />
SALES<br />
Consolidated sales for 2008 increased by seven per cent to SEK 3,356,6M (3,136.0). Acquisitions and organic growth explain the increase. Sales for the fourth quarter rose to SEK 778.0M (767.6). <br />
<br />
THE BEIJER REF BUSINESS AREA’S sales for 2008 increased by eight per cent to SEK 2,714.1M (2,520.5). Both acquisitions and organic growth explain the increase. Sales for the fourth quarter rose by three per cent to SEK 624.4M (606.6). Currency effects had a positive effect on sales. The markets in Switzerland, Norway, Finland and Denmark remained strong during the period. However, the markets in Poland and the Baltic states showed a slowdown. <br />
<br />
THE BEIJER TECH BUSINESS AREA’S sales for the full year increased by four per cent to SEK 642.5M (615.5). Organic growth amounted to seven per cent. Sales for the fourth quarter fell to SEK 153.6M (161.0). The general economic slowdown affected demand especially within manufacturing supplies and input goods whilst maintenance products and service developed well. <br />
<br />
OPERATING PROFIT<br />
The Group’s operating profit for 2008 increased by 13 per cent to SEK 338.3M (298.4). The result includes one-time gains of SEK 53.2M (5.9). Excluding one-time gains, profit amounted to SEK 285.1M (292.5). Operating profit for the fourth quarter was SEK 46.9M (64.1). <br />
<br />
BEIJER REF’S operating profit increased to SEK 270.4M (260.6) for the full year. Excluding one-time gains, the result amounted to SEK 247.7M (254.7). Operating profit for the fourth quarter amounted to SEK 42.8M (55.6). The lower result is explained by lower purchasing volumes for the full year in order to avoid inventory build-up, which meant lower revenues from volume-based agreements. Beijer Ref’s seasonal pattern normally shows lower results for the first and fourth quarters whilst the second and third quarters are relatively stronger.  <br />
<br />
BEIJER TECH’S operating profit rose to 85.6M (55.2) for the full year. Excluding one-time gains, the result amounted to SEK 55.1M (55.2). Operating profit for the fourth quarter fell to SEK 7.5M (12.5). The fall is mainly due to lower sales for the quarter. <br />
<br />
PROFIT BEFORE AND AFTER TAX<br />
The Group’s financial income/expense amounted to SEK -15.7M (-15.5) for the full year and to SEK -3.6M (-2.8) for the fourth quarter. Financial income/expense includes a share in the profits of associated companies of SEK 8.0M (10.3) and SEK 2.0M (4.7) for the respective period. Profit before taxes amounted to SEK 322.6M (282.9) for the full year and to SEK 43.3M (61.3) for the quarter. Profit after tax amounted to SEK 255.2M (212.5) for the full year and to SEK 31.2M (54.2) for the fourth quarter. Profit per share was SEK 20.58 (17.11) for the full year. Excluding one-time gains, profit per share amounted to SEK 16.29 (16.63). <br />
<br />
DIVIDEND<br />
The Board of Directors proposes a dividend of SEK 6.00 per share (6.00).<br />
<br />
OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION<br />
Consolidated capital expenditure, including acquisitions, amounted to SEK 91.6M (274.5) for the full year. Liquid funds, including unutilised bank overdraft facilities, were SEK 192.7M (199.4) on 31 December 2008. On the same date, shareholders’ equity amounted to SEK 989.9M (726.9). Net indebtedness was SEK 617.6M (617.9). The equity ratio was 44.6 per cent (36.6). The average number of employees during the year was 1,036 (966).<br />
<br />
SIGNIFICANT EVENTS<br />
After the end of the financial year, G &amp; L Beijer signed a final purchase agreement to acquire Carrier ARW on 13 January 2009. An Extraordinary General Meeting on 29 January 2009 resolved to carry out a non-cash issue by issuing 358,710 class A shares and 8,437,429 class B shares to Carrier Corporation and, therefore, increase the company’s share capital by SEK 153,932,432.50 as payment for the acquisition of Carrier ARW. This means that G &amp; L Beijer’s shareholders before the transaction and Carrier Corporation will hold 66.7 per cent and 33.3 per cent respectively of the votes and 58.5 per cent and 41.5 respectively of the capital in the company. The Extraordinary General Meeting also resolved that the number of Board Members shall be seven and to elect Phillippe Delpech and William Striebe as new Board Members with effect from the date of completion of the acquisition of Carrier ARW until the end of the next Annual Meeting of shareholders.<br />
<br />
The transaction was completed on 30 January 2009. The total capital contributed in kind has been valued at SEK 1,055.5M. The transaction means that G &amp; L Beijer’s pro forma sales will increase to approximately SEK 6,200M with an operating profit of SEK 527M calculated on the twelve-month period up to and including September 2008. The total number of employees will be approximately 1,800. G &amp; L Beijer will achieve a significantly strengthened financial position. Carrier ARW is included in G &amp; L Beijer’s account from 1 February 2009.  <br />
<br />
The merger of G &amp; L Beijer’s and Carrier ARW’s operations creates a strong group within refrigeration wholesale distribution in Europe and a solid platform for global expansion. G &amp; L Beijer and Carrier complement each other in Europe. Carrier is also a big operator in South Africa. The merged operations will work in 21 countries, including the Nordic countries and the Baltic States, United Kingdom, Holland, Spain, Belgium, Switzerland, France, Italy, some countries in Eastern Europe, and South Africa. Carrier ARW also contributes an extended product portfolio to G &amp; L Beijer’s current product programme. <br />
<br />
In June, G &amp; L Beijer acquired the Czech refrigeration wholesale company, Fridanair, through its Beijer Ref business area. The company reports sales of approximately SEK 30M and has 20 employees. Fridanair is included in G &amp; L Beijer’s accounts from 1 July 2008. <br />
<br />
In May, G &amp; L Beijer acquired the Industrial Hose business area within REC Indovent AB through its Beijer Tech business area. The operation reports sales of more than SEK 20M and has five employees. The acquisition is included in G &amp; L Beijer’s accounts from 1 June 2008.<br />
<br />
In May, G &amp; L Beijer acquired the Slovakian refrigeration wholesale company, RK Slovakia, through its Beijer Ref business area. The company reports sales of approximately SEK 10M and has nine employees. RK Slovakia is included in G &amp; L Beijer’s accounts from 1 May 2008. <br />
<br />
In April, G &amp; L Beijer acquired the distribution rights for Mitsubishi Heavy Industries’ products within the air-conditioning and heat-pump segments in Norway through its Beijer Ref business area. The operation reports annual sales of approximately SEK 20M and is included in the consolidated accounts from 1 May 2008.<br />
<br />
In April, G &amp; L Beijer acquired the operation in Hymab (Hydraul &amp; Maskinkomponenter i Örebro AB) through its Beijer Tech business area. The operation reports sales of approximately SEK 16M and has six employees. The operation in Hymab is included in G &amp; L Beijer’s accounts from 1 May 2008.<br />
<br />
In February, G &amp; L Beijer divested Brogårdsand AB with its subsidiary, Fyleverken, to Finja AB through its Beijer Tech business area. The transaction generated a capital gain of SEK 31M which is included in the consolidated accounts for the first quarter of 2008. Brogårdsand/Fyleverken is not included in G &amp; L Beijer’s accounts from 1 March 2008.<br />
<br />
In February, G &amp; L Beijer acquired the operation in Renheat AB through its Beijer Tech business area. The operation reports annual sales of approximately SEK 5M. The acquisition is included in G &amp; L Beijer’s accounts from 1 February 2008. <br />
<br />
In January, G &amp; L Beijer divested its agency operation, Svenska Daikin, through its Beijer Ref business area. Through the divestment, Beijer Ref realised a gain of SEK 23M which is included in the result for the first quarter of 2008. Svenska Daikin is not included in the consolidated accounts from 1 February 2008. <br />
<br />
RISK ASSESSMENT<br />
The operations of the G &amp; L Beijer Group are affected by a number of external factors, the effects of which on the Group’s operating profit can be controlled to a varying degree. The Group’s business areas are dependent on the general economic trend, especially in Europe, which controls the demand for the business areas’ products and services. Other operating risks such as agency and supplier agreements, product responsibility and delivery undertaking, technical development, warranties, dependence on individuals, etc, are continually being analysed and, when necessary, action is taken to reduce the Group’s risk exposure. In its operations, G &amp; L Beijer AB is exposed to financial risks such as currency risk, interest risk and liquidity risk. The parent company’s risk picture is the same as that of the Group.<br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today, 29 January 2009, G &amp; L Beijer held an Extraordinary General Meeting. Shareholders representing 42.8 per cent of capital and 70.4 per cent of votes had notified the company that they would attend the EGM.    <br />
<br />

<br />
- To carry out a non-cash issue by issuing 358,710 class A shares and 8,437,429 class B shares and, therefore, increase the company’s share capital by SEK 153,932,432.50 as payment for the acquisition of Carrier ARW. This means that G &amp; L Beijer’s original shareholders and Carrier will hold 66.7 per cent and 33.3 per cent respectively of the votes, and 58.5 per cent and 41.5 respectively of the capital in the company.<br />
<br />

The Board of Directors proposes that the Meeting resolves to increase the company’s registered share capital by SEK 153,932,432.50 through the issue of 358,710 series A shares and 8,437,429 series B shares. The right to subscribe for the new shares shall be granted Carrier Refrigeration ECR Holding Luxembourg S.a.r.l. and UTX Holdings SCS. Subscription to the new shares shall be made on a separate subscription form on <br />
13 February 2009 at the latest, with a right for the Board of Directors to prolong this time limit. Full payment of the issued shares shall be made by the above mentioned parties entitled to subscribe to the new shares by a non-cash contribution of all shares in PB Holdings Luxembourg S.a.r.l., General Frigorifique SAS and Delmo France SAS to G &amp; L Beijer AB. The reason for the new issue of shares is to enable the acquisition of Carrier Corporations’ refrigeration wholesaler business in Europe and South-Africa (“Carrier ARW”) by acquiring PB Holdings Luxembourg S.a.r.l., General Frigorifique SAS and Delmo France SAS including subsidiaries against payment with shares in G &amp; L Beijer AB. After the new share issue Carrier Refrigeration ECR Holding Luxembourg S.a.r.l. and UTX Holding SCS will in total own 8,796,139 shares in the company, representing 41.5 percent of the share capital and 33.3 percent of the votes in the company (excluding treasury shares).<br />
<br />
The new shares shall not entitle to dividend declared at the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders in April 2009. The shares will therefore not be listed for trading on NASDAQ OMX Stockholm (MidCap) until after the record day for dividend in connection with the Annual General Meeting 2009. <br />
<br />
The Swedish Securities Council (Sw. Aktiemarknadsnämnden) has granted Carrier Corporation an exemption from the provisions on mandatory bids provided that the resolution on a new share issue in kind is made by qualified majority. Consequently, a resolution in accordance with the Board of Director’s proposal under section 8, shall be valid only where supported by shareholders representing at least two thirds of both the submitted votes and the shares represented at the Meeting. <br />
<br />
Shareholders who together represent approximately 18.4 percent of the shares and approximately 54.8 percent of the votes in the company have undertaken to vote in favour of the proposal. <br />
<br />
Proposal regarding election of members of the Board of Directors and resolution regarding board fees (item 9 on the agenda)<br />
<br />
In view of the acquisition of Carrier ARW, shareholders representing 54.8 percent of the total number of votes in the company have proposed that the number of members of the Board shall be seven and that Philippe Delpech and William Striebe in addition to existing members of the Board are elected as new members of the Board with effect as from the completion of the acquisition until the end of the next Annual General Meeting, whereafter the Board of Directors has the following composition: Peter Jessen Jürgensen (chairman), Poul Friis, Anne-Marie Pålsson, Joen Magnusson, Bernt Ingman, Philippe Delpech and William Striebe.<br />
<br />
Philippe Delpech (b 1962), Master of Business Administration and Master of Engineering, is President of Carrier Commercial Refrigeration. Prior to his current position, Philippe Delpech has held a number of senior positions within the <br />
Carrier Group in Europe and Asia, including Vice President, Commercial Air Conditioning &amp; Services EMEA. Philippe Delpech has prior to his employment with the Carrier Group held different positions within Danfoss, ABB, Aerospatiale, Turbomeca and SKF. <br />
<br />

Prior to his current position, William Striebe has held a number of senior positions within the Carrier Group in Europe and the US, including Vice President Legal Affairs of the Carrier Group’s business in North America.  <br />
<br />
For the period up to and including the Annual General Meeting 2009, the new Board Members are proposed not to be awarded any fee. For the other Board Members, the resolution by the Annual General Meeting 2008 regarding fees shall remain in force.<br />
<br />
C. AVAILABLE DOCUMENTS<br />

The complete proposal of the Board and an information memorandum regarding the acquisition of Carrier ARW together with documents pursuant to Chapter 13 <br />
Sections 6-8 of the Swedish Companies Act will be available at the company and on the company’s website and copies thereof will be sent to any shareholders who so requests and state their address. The documents will also be available at the Meeting. <br />

<br />
The combined company will have a more complete and differentiated product offering. The new company will also offer customers wider European geographic coverage, with G &amp; L Beijer’s presence in Northern and Eastern Europe and Carrier’s presence in Southern Europe.<br />
<br />
- Capturing Synergies and Improving Productivity<br />
<br />

On the acquisition of Elsmark Holding A/S in June 2004, G &amp; L Beijer purchased 51% of the Equinoxe SP shares with an option to acquire the remaining 49%.  

Beijer Ref has now decided to exercise this option and has purchased the shares from the current MD and founder of Equinoxe SP.  

Equinoxe SP is the market leading refrigeration wholesaler in Hungary; it has an annual turnover of 5.5 million Euros and has shown good profitability. The company has 41 employees in 4 branches in Hungary; it is also responsible for Beijer Ref operations in Romania.  

This acquisition will have only a marginal impact on Beijer Ref’s financial performance.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>G &amp; L Beijer moves production to Sweden

G &amp; L Beijer AB is completing the consolidation of the production structure within business area Refrigeration by moving the production of cooling batteries from Denmark to Sweden. The Danish sales organisation will remain in Denmark. 

"The restructuring is a step in our continual, long-term rationalisation programme aimed at strengthening our competitiveness by reducing costs. As a result, we will increase the profitability of the manufacturing companies," says Joen Magnusson, Managing Director of G &amp; L Beijer.

At the beginning of 2004, G &amp; L Beijer decided to specialise the manufacturing units within the Refrigeration business area. The restructuring involved moving the production of stainless steel products in Denmark to Norway, whilst the production of dry coolers was moved to Sweden. 

The new production structure involves increased specialisation with increased volumes and a clearer focus for the respective manufacturing units. This will contribute to increased efficiency. In Denmark, the restructuring involved redundancies, whereas a need for recruiting new staff arose in Sweden and Norway. 

The changes have been implemented. The number of employees within business area Refrigeration's manufacturing companies, which amounted to 220, has been reduced by just under ten per cent. Cost savings and co-ordination benefits are estimated at SEK 7-8M on an annual basis and will make a full impact during 2005. 

The consolidation will be completed by moving the remaining manufacturing of cooling batteries in Denmark to Sweden. The staff affected by the cut-back in Denmark will, as far as possible, be offered employment in Sweden. In this phase, the staff requirement will reduce by approximately 20. This will generate additional cost savings. 

The restructuring is expected to be fully implemented during the first quarter of 2005.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Acquisition of Elsmark Holding completed

Today, 13 July 2004, G &amp; L Beijer has signed a final purchase agreement with the Danish company, Danfoss, for the acquisition of Elsmark. The acquired operation will be included in business area Beijer Refrigeration. The acquisition comprises six companies with operations in eight European countries. The companies report total sales of SEK 900M and have around 380 employees. 

The acquired companies, which are organised in a subsidiary of Danfoss, Elsmark Holding ApS, exellently supplement Beijer Refrigeration's geographic spread in Europe. The largest company in Elsmark is the British Dean &amp; Wood operation which has 19 branches. In addition, Danfoss/Elsmark has wholly-owned companies in the Netherlands Switzerland and Ireland. The company also owns 51 per cent of a company in Hungary, with a branch in Rumania and 50 per cent of a company in Poland, with branches in the Ukraine.

Beijer Refrigeration, which reported sales of nearly SEK 900M in 2003, has operations in the Nordic countries, Poland and the Baltic States. Recently, G &amp; L Beijer decided to enter also the Russian market through a new Finnish subsidiary. This means that Beijer Refrigeration will work in a total of 16 geographic markets in Europe. Beijer Refrigeration was already the leading refrigeration wholesaler in the Nordic countries. Through the acquisition of Elsmark it will be the largest wholesaler in Europe. 

The Elsmark group has approximately the same agencies and product range as Beijer Refrigeration. Danfoss is already an important and significant supplier to Beijer Refrigeration. The acquisition means that the collaboration between Beijer Refrigeration and Danfoss will be further strengthened. 

Elsmark Holding is profitable, but it has a significantly lower operating margin compared with Beijer Refrigeration. The long-term ambition is to raise the operating margin for the acquired companies. The short-term synergies are related to lower central costs, the co-ordination of purchasing and more efficient warehousing/logistics.
 
The acquisition involves goodwill of SEK 140M and will be financed via loans. Including the acquisition, the G &amp; L Beijer Group will report sales of approximately SEK 2.3 billion on an annual basis and have around 1,000 employees. 

The Elsmark group is included in G &amp; L Beijer's accounts from 1 June 2004. As a result, the acquisition will make a contribution to both sales and profit as early as the second quarter of 2004.

After the transaction, </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">G &amp; L Beijer holds no shares in Beijer Alma. The divestment generated sales proceeds of approximately SEK 365M. G &amp; L Beijer made a capital gain of more than SEK 50M which will be reported in the first quarter of 2011. The shares in Beijer Alma were received as part payment on the sale of Beijer Tech during the spring of 2010. As a result, total sales proceeds amounted to more than SEK 400M and the capital gain was approximately SEK 190M.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">The divestment of the shares is another step forward in creating increased scope to take action for the continued expansion within the strongly growing refrigeration wholesale operation. The transaction further strengthens G &amp; L Beijer&rsquo;s financial position. On 31 December 2010, the net debt amounted to SEK 395M. The net debt ratio was 0.17 and the equity ratio amounted to 60 per cent. </span></span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">G &amp; L Beijer has completed its strategic acquisition of the Italian SCM Frigo group. SCM Frigo designs, develops and builds chillers. The company reports annual sales of approximately SEK 220M with high profitability. The operation has around 70 employees. SCM Frigo is at the forefront of technical development of refrigeration units for new environmentally-friendly solutions. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">The collaboration between Beijer Ref and SCM Frigo has started very well. The acquisition has already generated the desired synergy effects with an increased number of orders for SCM Frigo&rsquo;s products from Beijer Ref&rsquo;s existing markets. G &amp; L Beijer has initially acquired 51 per cent of the shares in SCM Frigo with an option to acquire the remaining 49 per cent. SCM Frigo included in G &amp; L Beijer&rsquo;s accounts from 1 January 2011. </span></span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<ul>
<li><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="font-family: Arial">Net sales increased by six per cent to SEK 5,044.3M (4,757.7).</span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="font-family: Arial">Operating profit increased to SEK 484.0M (280.1) including a capital gain of SEK 140M from the divestment of Beijer Tech.&nbsp; </span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="font-family: Arial">Profit after tax rose to SEK 398.7M (192.1) including the capital gain of SEK 140M.</span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="font-family: Arial">Profit per share increased to SEK 18.85 (9.39). Excluding the capital gain, profit per share amounted to SEK 12.25.</span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="font-family: Arial">The Board of Directors proposes a dividend of SEK 8.00 (6.50). </span></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="font-family: Arial">Acquisitions in Thailand and Italy at the end of 2010 with expected combined annual sales of SEK 350M.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<p><em><span style="font-family: Arial"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><br />The above relates to the remaining operations and the capital gain from the divestment of Beijer Tech.</span></span></em></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial">Group<br /></span></strong></span><span style="font-family: Arial"><span style="font-size: 10pt">The positive trend continued in the fourth quarter. The G &amp; L Beijer Group reported an increased organic growth and also profit continued to improve. At the end of the first quarter, the Beijer Tech business area was divested. It means that Beijer Tech&rsquo;s sales and results are not included in the figures reported below. Consolidated sales for 2010 increased by six per cent to SEK 5,044.3M (4,757.7). Sales for the fourth quarter increased by three per cent to SEK 1,178.1M (1,140.0). Organic growth, excluding currency exchange rate effects, amounted to 11 per cent.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Operating profit for the year rose to SEK 484.0M (280.1). The profit includes a capital gain of SEK 140M from the divestment of Beijer Tech. Excluding this gain, operating profit amounted to SEK 344.0M, equivalent to an increase of 23 per cent compared to previous year. For the fourth quarter, operating profit increased by 27 per cent to SEK 80.1M (62.9).</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial">Beijer Ref<br /></span></strong></span><span style="font-family: Arial"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Beijer Ref&rsquo;s full-year sales increased by six per cent to SEK 5,044.3M (4,757.7). Organic growth amounted to 10 per cent. The stronger Swedish currency affected sales negatively when translated into SEK. Sales for the fourth quarter increased by three per cent to SEK 1,178.1M (1,140.0). Organic growth amounted to 11 per cent for the quarter. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial"><span style="font-size: 10pt">The trend from the previous quarter continued during the fourth quarter when virtually all markets in which Beijer Ref operates continued to show growth. Several markets, including South Africa, UK, Holland, Finland, France, Spain and Italy, reported especially positive sales growth. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Beijer Ref&rsquo;s operating profit increased by 22 per cent to SEK 365.8M (299.3) for the year. Operating profit for the fourth quarter increased by 24 per cent to SEK 84.2M (67.9). The improved results are essentially explained by increased sales volumes, synergies from the acquisition of Carrier ARW and strict control of expenses. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Towards the end of the year, Beijer Ref made two acquisitions with expected total annual sales of approximately SEK 350M. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial">Consolidated profit before and after tax</span></strong><span style="font-family: Arial"> <br /></span></span><span style="font-family: Arial"><span style="font-size: 10pt">The Group&rsquo;s financial income/expense for the year amounted to SEK 1.0M (-9.6) and to SEK -0.5M (0.3) for the fourth quarter. Financial income/expense includes a share in profits of associated companies of SEK 8.0M (7.4) and SEK 2.0 M (1.2) for the respective period. Profit before taxes including the capital gain amounted to SEK 485.0M (270.5) for the full year. It increased by 26 per cent to SEK 79.6M (63.2) for the fourth quarter. Profit after tax amounted to SEK 398.7M (192.1) and to SEK 61.1M (40.6) for the respective period. Profit per share amounted to SEK 18.85 (9.39) for the full year. Excluding the capital gain of SEK 140M, profit per share amounted to SEK 12.25 (9.39) for the remaining operations.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial">Dividend<br /></span></strong></span><span style="font-family: Arial"><span style="font-size: 10pt">The Board of Directors proposes a dividend of SEK 8.00 per share (6.50).</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial">Other financial information<br /></span></strong></span><span style="font-family: Arial"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Consolidated capital expenditure including acquisitions amounted to SEK 33.8M (1,132.5) for the full year. The cash flow from current operations amounted to SEK 244.2M (234.6). Liquid funds, including unutilised bank overdraft facilities, were SEK 478.4M (537.6) at the year end. Shareholders&rsquo; equity amounted to SEK 2,392.1M (2,175.5). Net indebtedness amounted to SEK 395.4M (400.2). The equity ratio was 60.3 per cent (54.3). The average number of employees during the period was 1,657 (1,591).</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial">Significant events<br /></span></strong></span><span style="font-family: Arial"><span style="font-size: 10pt">During the first quarter, G &amp; L Beijer divested its Beijer Tech business area to Beijer Alma. G &amp; L Beijer received a consideration of 2.7 million newly-issued B shares in Beijer Alma and SEK 38.7M in cash. In total, the transaction is valued at approximately SEK 345M and G &amp; L Beijer&rsquo;s capital gain amounted to SEK 140M. The divestment of Beijer Tech was a move forward in the consolidation of G &amp; L Beijer towards the refrigeration wholesale market. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial"><span style="font-size: 10pt">As a result of the transaction, G &amp; L Beijer became a significant shareholder in Beijer Alma. Beijer Tech&rsquo;s sales amounted to SEK 141.8M (140.1) for the first quarter of 2010 and the average number of employees was 175. Operating profit amounted to SEK 6.3M (6.5).</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial"><span style="font-size: 10pt">During the third quarter, Beijer Ref signed a strategic agreement with the French GDF Suez group, a leading company within the energy sector. The agreement, which is a global general agreement, means that Beijer Ref becomes a preferred supplier to GDF Suez. This is the first agreement of its kind that Beijer Ref has signed with a global customer.&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial"><span style="font-size: 10pt">In December, G &amp; L Beijer acquired the assets in Carrier Corporation&rsquo;s refrigeration wholesale operation in Thailand. The operation has yearly sales of approximately SEK 130M and has 50 employees. The acquisition was carried out through a jointly-owned company. Beijer&rsquo;s share amounts to 49 per cent of the capital and just above 50 per cent of the votes. The acquisition was </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="font-family: Arial">another step forward in Beijer Ref&rsquo;s global strategy where the Thai operation could form a platform for further expansion in South-East Asia. </span><span style="font-family: Arial">The acquisition did not impact the 2010 sales. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Arial"><span style="font-size: 10pt">At the end of the year, G &amp; L Beijer signed an agreement to acquire the Italian SCM Frigo group, which has annual sales of approximately SEK 220M. SCM Frigo designs, develops and builds chillers. The operation has 70 employees. The company is at the forefront of technical development of chillers for new environmentally-friendly solutions. SCM Frigo is also a leading supplier in Europe with regard to the assembly of conventional chillers. SCM Frigo is a strategic acquisition in a growing market. Environmentally-friendly and energy-efficient solutions are given increased priority within the refrigeration sector. Initially, G &amp; L Beijer acquires 51 per cent of the shares in SCM Frigo with an option to acquire the remaining 49 per cent.&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong><span style="font-family: Arial">Risk assessment<br /></span></strong></span><span style="font-family: Arial"><span style="font-size: 10pt">The operations of the G &amp; L Beijer Group are affected by a number of external factors, the effects of which on the Group&rsquo;s operating profit can be controlled to a varying degree. The Group&rsquo;s operations are dependent on the general economic trend, especially in Europe, which controls the demand for Beijer Ref&rsquo;s products and services. Acquisitions are normally linked with risks, for example staff defection. Other operating risks such as agency and supplier agreements, product responsibility and delivery undertaking, technical development, warranties, dependence on individuals, etc, are continually being analysed and, when necessary, action is taken to reduce the Group&rsquo;s risk exposure. In its operations, G &amp; L Beijer AB is exposed to financial risks such as currency risk, interest risk and liquidity risk. The parent company&rsquo;s risk picture is the same as that of the Group.</span></span></p>

The company is at the forefront of technical development of refrigeration units for new environmentally-friendly solutions. SCM Frigo is also a leading supplier in Europe with regard to assembly of conventional refrigeration units. The sellers are the current management who will remain in their respective positions after the acquisition. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">SCM Frigo is a strategic acquisition in a growing market. Environmentally-friendly and energy-efficient solutions are given increased priority within the refrigeration sector. SCM Frigo has developed a unique modular system for the assembly of refrigeration units which use natural refrigerants such as carbon dioxide or ammonia instead of conventional refrigerants.&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">SCM Frigo has delivered a large number of refrigeration units with carbon dioxide as a refrigerant to several large food chains in Scandinavia. The company was founded in 1979 and has reported a significant growth in sales in the past five years. The export share amounts to 75 per cent. The acquisition provides G &amp; L Beijer with a great opportunity to increase the sale of SCM Frigo&rsquo;s products in Beijer&rsquo;s existing markets.&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Initially, G &amp; L Beijer acquires 51 per cent of the shares in SCM Frigo with an option to acquire the remaining 49 per cent. SCM Frigo will be included in G &amp; L Beijer&rsquo;s accounts from 1 January 2011. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">The acquisition is expected to have a marginally positive effect on Beijer&rsquo;s key figures.</span></span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong>​</strong>G &amp; L Beijer AB has signed an agreement for the acquisition of the assets in Carrier Corporation&rsquo;s refrigeration wholesale operation in Thailand through Beijer Ref. The operation reports sales of SEK 130M and has around 50 employees. It is owned indirectly in equal parts by Carrier and B.Grimm Ltd. The owner of B.Grimm Ltd is Harald Link, a Board Member of G &amp; L Beijer.</span></span></p><p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">The acquisition will be made through the formation of a jointly-owned company, Beijer B.Grimm (Thailand) Ltd. Beijer&rsquo;s holding represents 49 per cent of the shares and more than 50 per cent of the votes. The remaining portion will be owned by B.Grimm Ltd.</span></span></p>
</p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Beijer&rsquo;s share of the purchase price amounts to SEK 28M and relates to the net assets in the company. The company will be reported as a subsidiary of G &amp; L Beijer as from January 2011.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">The acquisition is a move forward in Beijer&rsquo;s global strategy. The Thai operation provides an opportunity to form a platform for further expansion in South-East Asia. The acquisition is a result of the collaboration with Carrier Corporation, which is G &amp; L Beijer&rsquo;s largest individual shareholder.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">The acquisition is expected to have a marginally positive effect on Beijer&rsquo;s key figures.</span></span></p>

Organic growth strengthened whilst profit continued to improve. At the end of the first quarter, the Beijer Tech business area was divested. It means that Beijer Tech&rsquo;s sales and results are not included in the figures reported below. Consolidated sales for the first nine months of the year increased by seven per cent to SEK 3,866.2M (3,617.7). Sales for the third quarter rose by six per cent to SEK 1,410.6M (1,325.0). In local currencies, sales for the third quarter increased by 12 per cent.</span></span><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Consolidated operating profit for the first three quarters rose to SEK 403.8M (217.3).

Organic growth amounted to approximately nine per cent. Acquisitions affected sales positively, as Carrier ARW was not included in the figures for January 2009, whilst a strengthened Swedish currency affected sales negatively when translated into SEK. Sales for the third quarter increased by six per cent to SEK 1,410.6M (1,325.0). Organic growth for the third quarter amounted to 12 per cent. Virtually all markets reported a good development.

Operating profit for the third quarter rose by 23 per cent to SEK 127.7M (104.0). The improved results are essentially explained by increased sales volumes and strict control of expenses. Savings and structural measures in Carrier ARW have been implemented according to plan.

G &amp; L Beijer received a consideration of 2.7 million newly-issued B shares in Beijer Alma and SEK 38.7M in cash. In total, the transaction is valued at approximately SEK 345M and G &amp; L Beijer&rsquo;s capital gain amounted to SEK 140M. The divestment of Beijer Tech was a move forward in the concentration of G &amp; L Beijer towards the strongly growing refrigeration wholesale operation. As a result of the transaction, G &amp; L Beijer became a significant shareholder in Beijer Alma.</span></span><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

The agreement, which is a global general agreement, means that Beijer Ref becomes a preferred supplier to GDF Suez in all markets. The contract covers Beijer Ref&rsquo;s entire product programme which covers refrigeration systems and comfort cooling. This is the first agreement of its kind that Beijer Ref has signed with a global customer. GDF Suez is already a customer of Beijer Ref in some markets. The agreement offers a significant potential for increasing sales to GDF Suez in both existing and new markets.</span></span><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size: 10pt">- Net sales increased by seven per cent to SEK 2,455.6M (2,292.7).<br />- Operating profit increased to SEK 281.5M (118.1), including a capital gain of SEK 140M.<br />&nbsp;- Profit after tax increased to SEK 246.2M (79.9) including a capital gain of SEK 140M.<br />- Profit per share amounted to SEK 11.62 (4.05). Excluding the capital gain, profit per share amounted to SEK 5.01.<br />- Continued good organic growth.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt"><em>The above refers to remaining operations and a capital gain from the divestment of Beijer Tech.</em><em>&nbsp;</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong>Group<br /></strong>The G &amp; L Beijer Group reported a continued strong development for the second quarter. Organic growth, when adjusted for acquisitions and currency effects, was approximately seven per cent whilst profit improved. The positive trend strengthened at the end of the period. The start of the third quarter has been good as Beijer Ref benefits from the hot weather in Europe. At the end of the first quarter, the Beijer Tech business area was divested. It means that Beijer Tech&rsquo;s sales and results are not included in the figures reported below. Consolidated sales for the first six months of the year increased by seven per cent to SEK 2,455.6M (2,292.7). Sales for the second quarter amounted to SEK 1,325.7M (1,325.4). In local currencies, sales increased by approximately seven per cent.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt">Consolidated operating profit for the first six months rose to SEK 281.5M (118.1). The result includes a capital gain of SEK 140M from the divestment of Beijer Tech. Excluding this gain, operating profit amounted to SEK 141.5M, equivalent to an increase of 20 per cent. For the second quarter, consolidated operating profit increased by 20 per cent to SEK 101.0M (84.0).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong>Beijer Ref<br /></strong>Beijer Ref&rsquo;s sales for the fist half of the year increased by seven per cent to SEK 2,455.6M (2,292.7). Organic growth amounted to approximately five per cent. Acquisitions affected sales positively, as Carrier ARW was not included in the figures for January 2009, whilst generally weaker foreign currencies affected sales negatively when translated into SEK. Sales for the second quarter amounted to SEK 1,325.7M (1,325.4). Organic growth amounted to approximately seven per cent. Virtually all markets reported a good development. United Kingdom, Italy and Spain all showed an especially positive sale growth. Eastern Europe reported a strong recovery from low levels.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt">Beijer Ref&rsquo;s operating profit increased by 21 per cent to SEK 153.9M (127.4) for the first half of the year. Operating profit for the second quarter rose by 19 per cent to SEK 107.6M (90.2). The increase means improved operating margins. The improved result is essentially explained by increased sales volumes and strict control of expenses. Savings and structural measures have been implemented in Carrier ARW. These have generated, and will continue to generate, positive effects on the result.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong>Consolidated profit before and after tax<br /></strong>The Group&rsquo;s financial income/expense for the six months amounted to SEK -0.8M (-9.4) and to SEK -0.8M (-4.8) for the second quarter. Financial income/expense includes a share in profits of SEK 4.0M (2.7) accumulated and SEK 2.0 M (0.9) for the period, relating to Malm&ouml; Hamn. Profit before taxes amounted to SEK 280.7M (108.7) for the first half of the year and to SEK 100.2M (79.2) for the second quarter. Profit after tax amounted to SEK 246.2M (79.9) and to SEK 77.5M (57.7) for the respective period. Profit per share amounted to SEK 11.62 (4.05) for the six-month period. Excluding the capital gain of SEK 140M, profit per share amounted to SEK 5.01 (4.05) for the remaining operations.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong>Other financial information<br /></strong>Consolidated capital expenditure amounted to SEK 13.4M (25.0). Liquid funds, including unutilised bank overdraft facilities, were SEK 436.2M (322.4) at the end of the half year. Shareholders&rsquo; equity amounted to SEK 2,190.1M (2,077.6). Net debt amounted to SEK 542.6M (687.1). The equity ratio was 51.9 per cent (47.5). The average number of employees during the period was 1,674 (1,566).&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong>Significant events<br /></strong>During the first quarter, G &amp; L Beijer divested its Beijer Tech business area to Beijer Alma. G &amp; L Beijer received a consideration of 2.7 million newly-issued B shares in Beijer Alma and SEK 38.7M in cash.

The divestment of Beijer Tech was a move forward in the consolidation of G &amp; L Beijer towards the strongly growing refrigeration wholesale operation.

<p><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong>Risk assessment<br /></strong>The operations of the G &amp; L Beijer Group are affected by a number of external factors, the effects of which on the Group&rsquo;s operating profit can be controlled to a varying degree.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today, 28 April 2010, G &amp; L Beijer AB (publ) held its Annual Meeting of shareholders for the 2009 financial year. The Annual Meeting adopted the profit and loss account and balance sheet for the parent company and the Group. The Board Members and the Managing Director were discharged from liability.   

The Annual Meeting endorsed the Board of Directors’ proposal for a dividend of SEK 6.50 per share and 3 May 2010 as the record day. The dividend is expected to be remitted by Euroclear Sweden AB on 6 May 2010. 

In his speech at the Annual Meeting, The Managing Director of G &amp; L Beijer, Joen Magnusson, gave an account of the company’s operations during 2009 and for the first quarter of 2010. He stated that the first quarter had been strong with improved sales and results.  

In addition, the Annual Meeting of shareholders passed the following resolutions:

• that the Board Members will be seven and that no Deputy Board Members will be elected.
• that the Directors’ fees will be SEK 985,000. The Chairman will receive SEK 340,000 and the Board Members who are not employed in the company or within the Carrier Group will receive SEK 215,000 each.

• that Peter Jessen Jürgensen, Anne-Marie Pålsson, Bernt Ingman, Joen Magnusson, Philippe Delpech and William Stribe are re-elected as Board Members. The Annual Meeting also resolved that Harald Link is elected as a Board Member and that Peter Jessen Jürgensen is appointed Chairman of the Board. 
• that the public accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers, is appointed as the company’s auditor for the remaining time period until the end of the 2012 Annual Meeting of shareholders with the Authorised Public Accountant, Mikael Eriksson, in charge until further notice. 
• that the company shall have an Election Committee consisting of one representative of each of the company’s three largest shareholders together with the Chairman of the Board. When the composition of the Election Committee is decided, the conditions on the last banking date in August 2010 shall determine who are the largest owners. If any of the three largest shareholders refrains from appointing a Member, the right shall be passed on to the owner who is next in size. The names of the Members, including the Chairman, and the shareholders who have appointed them shall be announced as soon as possible and not later than six months prior to the 2011 Annual Meeting of shareholders, when the following shall apply:
- The Members of the Election Committee shall appoint the Chairman of the Election Committee who must not be a Board Member. 
   - No special remuneration shall be paid for the work in the Election Committee. 
   - A shareholder who has appointed a Member of the Election Committee may remove the Member and appoint a new Member and, when required, replace a Member who has left the Election Committee before the work has been completed. If a Member no longer represents one of the three largest owners, such a Member can resign, if the Election Committee finds it appropriate, and a replacement can be appointed by the owner who has by then become the third largest owner.
   - Changes in the composition of the Election Committee, if any, shall be announced as soon as they have been made.  
   - The Election Committee shall work out proposals to be placed before the 2011 Annual Meeting of shareholders for resolutions on the following matters: (a) Chairman of the Annual Meeting of shareholders, (b) Board of Directors, (c) Chairman of the Board, (d) Directors’ fees, (e) remuneration of the company’s Auditors and (f) rules for the appointment of the Election Committee ahead of the 2012 Annual Meeting of shareholders.
 
• that the guidelines for the remuneration and other terms of employment for senior executives are adopted as follows: By senior executive is meant the Managing Director, the Chief Financial Officer and the Head of Beijer Ref. The remuneration shall consist of a fixed salary, a variable salary, a pension and other remuneration such as a company car. The total remuneration shall be on market terms and support the interest of the shareholders by enabling the company to attract and retain senior executives. The fixed salary is renegotiated annually and takes into account the area of responsibility, competence, performance and experience of the individual. The variable part of the salary is based on qualitative and quantitative target fulfilment. The individual will receive a maximum amount equivalent to one months’ salary. On the maximum outcome, the total cost for the variable portion of the salary is estimated to amount to SEK 1,000,000. The Executive Management’s pension scheme is contribution-based. An amount equivalent to 26 per cent of the gross salary, including variable salary, is appropriated annually for the Managing Director, and to an amount of up to 24 per cent of the gross salary, including variable salary, for the other Members of the Executive Management. Severance pay of not more than 24 months’ salary will be paid to the Managing Director. Severance pay to the other Members of the Executive Management varies and amounts to not more than 24 months’ salary including salary at notice. The Executive Management can give six months’ notice of termination. Notice of termination by the Managing Director or other senior executives does not trigger any severance pay. The Board of Directors prepares matters of remuneration and other terms of employment for the Executive Management and the Board of Directors as a whole constitutes the Remuneration Committee. The Managing Director does not participate in the work. The Board of Directors may abandon these guidelines if there are specific reasons for it in an individual case.

• that Para 10, subpara one, of the Articles of Association relating to the way of giving notice of a meeting of shareholders is amended as follows: Notice shall be made through an advertisement in Post- och Inrikes Tidningar and on the company’s website. The fact that notice has been given shall be advertised in Dagens Industri. In addition, the Board of Directors proposes that the resolution by the Annual Meeting regarding amendment of to the Articles of Association shall be conditional on an amendment to the Companies Act’s (SFS 2005:551) rules relating to the way of notice having come into force, which means that the proposed wording of Para 10, subpara one above is compatible with the Companies Act.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>- Net sales increased by 17 per cent to SEK 1,129.9M (967.4).
- Operating profit increased to SEK 180.5M (34.1), including a capital gain of SEK 140M.
- Profit after tax amounted to SEK 168,7M (22.3), including a capital gain of SEK 140M.  
- Profit per share amounted to SEK 7.96 (1.22).
- Profit per share, excluding a capital gain, was SEK 1.35 (1.22).
- Divestment of the Beijer Tech business area.
- Further strengthened financial position.

The above refers to remaining operations and a capital gain from the divestment of Beijer Tech.


Group 
The G &amp; L Beijer Group reported a strong development during for the first quarter. During the period, the Beijer Tech business area was divested. This means that Beijer Tech’s sales and results are not included in the figures reported below. Consolidated sales increased by 17 per cent to SEK 1,129.9M (967.4). Operating profit rose to SEK 180.5M (34.1). Operating profit for 2010 includes a capital gain of SEK 140M from the divestment of Beijer Tech. Excluding this gain, operating profit amounted to SEK 40.5M. The positive trend, including an increase in demand, has strengthened in April.  

Beijer Ref
Beijer Ref’s sales increased by 17 per cent to SEK 1,129.9M (967.4). When adjusted for acquisitions and currency effects, the increase amounted to four per cent. Acquisitions affected sales positively 
(Carrier ARW was not included in the figures for January 2009) whilst the currency effects had a negative influence. The markets in southern Europe, where the downturn at the end of 2008 started, are among the first to experience the upturn. Italy and Spain reported two-digit growth figures in local currency. South Africa, United Kingdom and Holland also developed strongly. The Nordic markets were stable. The East European markets experienced some degree of recovery during the period. 

Beijer Ref’s operating profit increased by 24 per cent to SEK 46.3M (37.2) for the quarter. The improved result is explained by increased sales and the continuing effects of savings measures. If acquired units had been included in the reported result from 1 January 2009, the profit improvement is significantly larger. Historically, Beijer Ref has a marked seasonal pattern with relatively weak first and fourth quarters and strong second and third quarters. In addition, Beijer Ref has historically been positioned late in the business cycle.  


Consolidated profit before and after tax
The Group’s financial income/expense amounted to SEK 0.1M (-4.6). Financial income/expense includes a share in the profits of associated companies of SEK 2.0M (1.8). Profit before tax rose to SEK 180.6M (29.5). Excluding a capital gain of SEK 140M, profit amounted to SEK 40.6M. Profit after tax amounted to SEK 168.7M (22.3). Profit per share increased to SEK 7.96 (1.22). Excluding a capital gain of SEK 140M, profit per share amounted to SEK 1.35 for the remaining operations for the first quarter of 2010. 


Other financial information
Consolidated capital expenditure amounted to SEK 5.0M (14.1). Liquid funds, including unutilised bank overdraft facilities, were SEK 498.3M (363.5) at the end of the quarter. Shareholders’ equity amounted to SEK 2,279.3M (2,077.8). Net indebtedness amounted to SEK 376.1M (595.4). The equity ratio was 57.8 per cent (49.5). The average number of employees during the period was 1,658 (1,412).


Significant events 
During the quarter, G &amp; L Beijer divested its Beijer Tech business area to Beijer Alma. G &amp; L Beijer received a consideration of 2.7 million newly-issued B shares in Beijer Alma and SEK 38.7M in cash. In total, the transaction is valued at approximately SEK 345M and G &amp; L Beijer’s capital gain amounted to SEK 140M. The divestment of Beijer Tech was a move forward in the consolidation of G &amp; L Beijer towards the strongly growing refrigeration wholesale operation. As a result of the transaction, G &amp; L Beijer became a significant shareholder in Beijer Alma.  

Beijer Tech’s sales amounted to SEK 141.8M (140.1) for the first quarter of 2010 and the average number of employees was 175. Operating profit amounted to SEK 6.3M (6.5). 


Risk assessment
The operations of the G &amp; L Beijer Group are affected by a number of external factors, the effects of which on the Group’s operating profit can be controlled to a varying degree. The Group’s operations are dependent on the general economic trend, especially in Europe, which controls the demand for Beijer Ref’s products and services. Acquisitions are normally linked with risks, for example staff defection. Other operating risks such as agency and supplier agreements, product responsibility and delivery undertaking, technical development, warranties, dependence on individuals, etc, are continually being analysed and, when necessary, action is taken to reduce the Group’s risk exposure. In its operations, G &amp; L Beijer AB is exposed to financial risks such as currency risk, interest risk and liquidity risk. The parent company’s risk picture is the same as that of the Group.

Item 14 – Resolution regarding guidelines for the remuneration of senior executives  

The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting adopts guidelines for remuneration and other terms of employment for senior executives as follows. For this purpose, senior executive is defined as the Managing Director, the Chief Financial Officer and the Head of Beijer Ref.

The remuneration shall consist of a fixed salary, a variable salary, a pension and other remuneration such as a company car. The total remuneration shall be on market terms and support the interest of the shareholders by enabling the company to attract and retain senior executives.  

The fixed salary is renegotiated annually and takes into account the area of responsibility, 
competence, performance and experience of the individual. The variable part of the salary is based on qualitative and quantitative target fulfilment. The individual will receive a maximum amount equivalent to one months’ salary. On the maximum outcome, the cost for the variable portion of the salary is estimated to amount to approximately SEK 1,000.000, in total. 

The Executive Management’s pension scheme is contribution-based. An amount equivalent to 26 
per cent of the gross salary, including variable salary, is appropriated annually for the Managing 
Director, and to an amount of up to 24 per cent of the gross salary, including variable salary, for the other Members of the Executive Management. 

Severance pay of not more than 24 months’ salary will be paid to the Managing Director. Severance pay to the other Members of the Executive Management varies and amounts to no more than 24 months’ salary including salary upon notice. The Executive Management has a notice of termination of six months. Notice of termination by the Managing Director or other senior executives does not trigger any severance pay.

The Board of Directors prepares matters of remuneration and other terms of employment for the

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>G &amp; L Beijer AB has signed a letter of intent to divest its Beijer Tech business area to Beijer Alma. G &amp; L Beijer will receive a consideration consisting of 2.7 million shares in Beijer Alma and a cash portion of SEK 39M. The value of the shares on 12 February amounted to SEK 278M. As a result of the deal, G &amp; L Beijer will report a tax-free capital gain of approximately SEK 120M. 

“Through the transaction with Beijer Alma, G &amp; L Beijer is taking a further step in its strategic development of the company. The divestment of Beijer Tech is a move forward in the consolidation of G &amp; L Beijer towards the strongly growing operation within G &amp; L Beijer’s refrigeration wholesale business. We will now be able to concentrate our focus on investing our resources in developing Beijer Ref into a global operator within the refrigeration sector,” says Joen Magnusson, Managing Director and CEO of G &amp; L Beijer.

Beijer Tech reported sales of SEK 505M in 2009 and has 180 employees. Beijer Tech, which has been included as a separate business area in G &amp; L Beijer, carries out an extensive operation within technology trading in the Nordic markets. Beijer Tech has six product areas – Surface Treatment, Foundry, Steelworks &amp; Smelters, Fluid Technology, Industrial Rubber and Services. Beijer Alma, which is listed on the NASDAQ OMX Stockholm Exchange, is an international industrial group which focuses on manufacturing components.  

“As a result of the transaction, G &amp; L Beijer becomes the second largest owner in Beijer Alma from a capital viewpoint, with approximately nine per cent of the capital. In our opinion, Beijer Alma will be an excellent environment for the continued development of Beijer Tech’s technology trading and we will monitor the development closely,” says Joen Magnusson.

The transaction is made on a debt-free basis and G &amp; L Beijer will further strengthen its financial position. Financial assets amounting to SEK 317M will be added to the G &amp; L Beijer Group and its net debt will decrease. The transaction is expected to be completed during March 2010.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>2009 FULL YEAR
- Net sales increased by 57 per cent to SEK 5,263.2M (3,356.6). 
- Operating profit amounted to SEK 300.7M (283.2). 
Including one-time gains of SEK 53.2M, operating profit was SEK 336.4M in 2008. 
- Profit after tax amounted to SEK 206.0M (202.0). 
Including one-time gains of SEK 53.2M, profit after tax was SEK 255.2M in 2008. 
- Profit per share amounted to SEK 10.07 (16.29). 
Including one-time gains, profit per share was SEK 20.58 in 2008.
- Strong cash flow from operations including change in working capital equivalent to SEK 21.69 per share.
- The Board of Directors proposes a dividend of SEK 6.50 per share (6.00).

FOURTH QUARTER
- Increased profit for the period.
- Positive end of the year.


SALES
G &amp; L Beijer ended the year on a positive note. Full-year sales increased by 57 per cent to SEK 5,263.2M (3,356.6). Sales for the fourth quarter rose by 63 per cent to 1,270.6M (778.0). The sales increase for the full year and for the fourth quarter is explained by the acquisition of Carrier ARW which is included in G &amp; L Beijer’s accounts from 1 February 2009. 

THE BEIJER REF BUSINESS AREA’S sales increased by 75 per cent to SEK 4,757.8M (2,714.1) for the full year. Sales for the fourth quarter rose by 83 per cent to SEK 1,140.0M (624.4). The increase is due to the acquisition of Carrier ARW. Full-year sales for comparable units fell by six per cent. Currency effects had a positive impact on sales of approximately six per cent. Sales for the acquired operations, which were included during February-December, amounted to SEK 2,304M. Sales for the acquired operations amounted to SEK 592.8M for the fourth quarter. 

THE BEIJER TECH BUSINESS AREA’S sales amounted to SEK 505.4M (642.5) for the full year. Sales for the fourth quarter amounted to SEK 130.6M (153.6). The fall is due to the weak demand within the manufacturing industry in which Beijer Tech’s main customers are located. During the second half of the year there were signs of a recovery compared with the corresponding period last year. 

OPERATING PROFIT
The Group’s operating profit increased to SEK 300.7M (283.2) for the full year. Including one-time gains of SEK 53.2M, profit for 2008 amounted to SEK 336.4M. Profit for the fourth quarter increased by 50 per cent to SEK 67,6M (45.0). 

BEIJER REF’S operating profit for the full year increased by 21 per cent to SEK 299.3M (247.7). Including one-time gains of SEK 22.7M, the result for 2008 was SEK 270.4M. Operating profit for the fourth quarter increased by 59 per cent to SEK 67.9M (42.8). The acquired units contributed positively to the result. Different savings measures generated the desired effect. The co-ordination with the acquired units proceeded according to plan. 

Operating profit for BEIJER TECH amounted to SEK 20.6M (55.1) for the full year. Including one-time gains of SEK 30.5M, the result was SEK 85.6 for 2008. Operating profit for the fourth quarter amounted to SEK 4.7M (7.5). The fall in profit is mainly explained by lower sales volumes. Non-recurring costs of approximately SEK 6M were charged to the full-year result. At the same time, savings programmes mitigated the fall in profit. 

PROFIT BEFORE AND AFTER TAX
The Group’s financial income/expense amounted to SEK -10.8M (-14.4) for the full year and to SEK 0.1M (-2.2) for the fourth quarter. Financial income/expense includes a share in the profits of Malmö Hamn of SEK 7.4M (9.4) and SEK 1.2M (3.4) for the respective period. Profit before taxes amounted to SEK 289.9M (322.0) for the full year and to SEK 67.7M (42.8) for the fourth quarter. Profit after tax amounted to SEK 206.0M (255.2) and to SEK 42.7M (31.2) for the respective period. Profit per share amounted to SEK 10.07 (16.29) for the full year. Including one-time gains, profit per share amounted to SEK 20.58 for 2008. Profit per share for the fourth quarter amounted to SEK 2.09 (2.52).

DIVIDEND
The Board of Directors proposes a dividend of SEK 6.50 per share (6.00).  

OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION
Consolidated capital expenditure, including acquisitions, amounted to SEK 1,160.3M (91.6) for the full year. Cash flow from current operations, including changes in working capital, amounted to SEK 443.7M (67.2). Liquid funds, including unutilised bank overdraft facilities, were SEK 537.6M (192.7) at the year end. Share¬holders’ equity amounted to SEK 2,175.5M (990.0). The increase is explained by the non-cash issue on the acquisition of Carrier ARW and net profit for the year. The non-cash issue added shareholders’ equity of SEK 1,055.5M to the Group. The value of the newly-issued shares is based on the market value on the date of acquisition. Net indebtedness amounted to SEK 400.2M (617.6). The equity ratio was 54.1 per cent (44.6). The average number of employees during the year was 1,765 (1,036).

SIGNIFICANT EVENTS
On 13 January 2009, G &amp; L Beijer signed a final purchase agreement to acquire Carrier ARW. An Extraordinary General Meeting on 29 January 2009 resolved to carry out a non-cash issue by issuing 358,710 class A shares and 8,437,429 class B shares to Carrier Corporation and, therefore, increase the company’s share capital by SEK 153,932,432.50 as payment for the acquisition of Carrier ARW. This meant that G &amp; L Beijer’s shareholders before the transaction and Carrier Corporation hold 66.7 per cent and 33.3 per cent respectively of the votes and 58.5 per cent and 41.5 respectively of the capital in the company. 

The transaction was completed on 30 January 2009. The total capital contributed in kind has been valued at SEK 1,055.5M. Carrier ARW is included in G &amp; L Beijer’s accounts from 1 February 2009.  

The merger of G &amp; L Beijer’s and Carrier ARW’s operations creates a strong group within refrigeration wholesale distribution in Europe and a solid platform for global expansion. G &amp; L Beijer and Carrier complement each other in Europe. Carrier is also a big operator in South Africa. The merged operations work in 22 countries, including the Nordic countries and the Baltic States, United Kingdom, Holland, Spain, Belgium, Switzerland, France, Italy, some countries in Eastern Europe, and South Africa. Carrier ARW also contributes an extended product portfolio to G &amp; L Beijer’s current product programme.

G &amp; L Beijer acquired the hose and rubber company, Slang-Pac AB in Stockholm, through its Beijer Tech business area. Slang-Pac, which reports sales of SEK 40M and has 14 employees, is included in G &amp; L Beijer’s accounts from 1 November 2009. 

RISK ASSESSMENT
The operations of the G &amp; L Beijer Group are affected by a number of external factors, the effects of which on the Group’s operating profit can be controlled to a varying degree. The Group’s business areas are dependent on the general economic trend, especially in Europe, which controls the demand for the business areas’ products and services. Acquisitions are normally linked with risks, for example staff defection. Other operating risks such as agency and supplier agreements, product responsibility and delivery undertaking, technical development, warranties, dependence on individuals, etc, are continually being analysed and, when necessary, action is taken to reduce the Group’s risk exposure. In its operations, G &amp; L Beijer AB is exposed to financial risks such as currency risk, interest risk and liquidity risk. The parent company’s risk picture is the same as that of the Group.

FINANCIAL INFORMATION
- The Annual Report for 2009 will be published on the company’s website, www.beijers.com, at the beginning of April 2010. It will also be mailed to the shareholders. 
- The Three-Month Report for 2010 will be published on 27 April 2010.
- The Annual Meeting of shareholders will held in Malmö on Wednesday 28 April 2010.

This Interim Report has not been the subject of special examination
by the company’s auditors.

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES
This interim report has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34.

As far as G &amp; L Beijer AB is concerned, the following issued standards and interpretations, which came into force on 1 January 2009, have been deemed to be relevant to the formulation of the financial report and its reporting principles:  

- IFRS 8, Operational segments.
This standard takes as its starting point that segmental information shall be presented from the management’s perspective. G &amp; L Beijer AB’s segmental information has already in the past been based on the internal reporting provided by the highest executive decision maker (The Managing Director). The 
result is that G &amp; L Beijer AB’s segmental classification does not change compared with what has previously been presented in accordance with  IAS 14.

- IAS 1, Layout of financial reports.
The amendment to this standard involves a change to the layout of the financial reports. In accordance with IAS 1, G &amp; L Beijer AB has chosen to present the Group’s total results divided into two reports, a profit and loss account and a report on the other total results. In addition, the Group’s change in the shareholders’ equity statement reports only transactions with the owners.  

Otherwise, G &amp; L Beijer AB continues to apply the same reporting principles and valuation methods as those described in the latest Annual Report.

<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual Meeting adopts guidelines for remuneration and other terms of employment for senior executives as follows. By senior executive is meant the Managing Director, the Chief Financial Officer, the Managing Director of G &amp; L Beijer Ref AB and the Chief Operating Officer of Toshiba HVAC.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">The remuneration shall consist of a fixed salary, a variable salary, a pension and other remuneration such as a company car. The total remuneration shall be on market terms and support the interest of the shareholders by enabling the company to attract and retain senior executives. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">The fixed salary is renegotiated annually and takes into account the area of responsibility, competence, performance and experience of the individual. The variable salary is based on the outcome in relation to set financial targets. The individual will receive a maximum amount equivalent to six months&rsquo; salary. On the maximum outcome, the cost for the variable salary is estimated to amount to SEK 4.3M in total. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">The Executive Management&rsquo;s pension scheme is contribution-based. An amount equivalent to 26 per cent of the gross salary is appropriated annually for the Managing Director, and an amount equivalent to not more than 24 per cent of the gross salary is appropriated annually for the other Members of the Executive Management. </span></p>

<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">The Executive Management can give six months&rsquo; notice of termination. Notice of termination by the Managing Director or other senior executives does not trigger any severance pay.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">The Board of Directors prepares matters of remuneration and other terms of employment for the Executive Management and the Board of Directors as a whole constitutes the Remuneration Committee. The Managing Director does not participate in the work. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">The Board of Directors may abandon these guidelines if there are specific reasons for it in an individual case.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Item 15 &ndash; Resolution regarding a share split </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual Meeting passes a resolution regarding a share split so that each existing share is split into two shares of the same class. The proposal means that the number of shares is doubled and that the quotient value of the share is halved. After the share split has been carried out, the company will have 42,478,230 shares represented by 3,306,240 A shares and 39,171,990 B shares. The objective of the share split is to increase the liquidity in the share. If the Meeting passes a resolution in accordance with the proposal, the Board of Directors will decide that 31 May 2012 will be the date of execution for the share split at Euroclear Sweden AB.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Item 16 &ndash; Resolution regarding amendment to the Articles of Association </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual Meeting passes a resolution regarding amendment to the Articles of Association on account of the proposed share split. The Board&rsquo;s proposal means that the limits for number of shares in Para 5 are amended so that the lowest number of shares shall be 20,000,000 and the highest number of shares shall be 80,000,000.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">For the resolution regarding amendment to the Articles of Association under this item to be valid, the resolution must be supported by shareholders representing at least two thirds of the votes cast and the shares represented at the Annual Meeting. The Board of Directors&rsquo; proposal under items 15 and 16 also includes authorisation for the Managing Director to make any minor adjustments in the Annual Meeting&rsquo;s resolutions which may be necessary in connection with registration at the Company Registration or Euroclear.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><strong></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Net sales increased by 16 per cent to SEK 5,846.4M (5,044.3).</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Operating profit rose by 26 per cent to SEK 432.5M (344.0).</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Profit for the year increased by 45 per cent to SEK 374.1M (258.7) including a capital gain of SEK 51.7M from the divestment of shares in Beijer Alma.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Profit per share amounted to SEK 16.98 (18,85). Excluding the capital gain, profit per share amounted to SEK 15.19 (12.25).</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Board of Directors proposes a dividend of SEK 9.00 (8.00).</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Share split 2:1.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><em>&nbsp;<br />The above relates to the remaining operation </em></span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">G &amp; L Beijer is a technology-oriented trading Group which, through a combination of added-value agency products and products of the company&rsquo;s own development, offers competitive solutions within refrigeration and air conditioning.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong>Sales</strong><br />G &amp; L Beijer ended the year robustly with strong growth and a significant increase in profit. It meant that the Group reported its highest sales so far and a new record profit from the current operation. Sales for the 2011 full year increased by 16 per cent to SEK 5,846.4M (5,044.3). Organically, sales increased by approximately seven per cent. At the end of the first quarter of 2010, the Beijer Tech business area was divested, which means that Beijer Tech&rsquo;s sales and results are not included in the comparative figures for 2010. The subsidiary, AIA, was divested at the end of 2011 and is not included in sales and profit for 2011 as these items relate only to the remaining operation. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Consolidated sales for the fourth quarter increased by 38 per cent to SEK 1,630.1M (1,178.1). The large acquisitions of Toshiba&rsquo;s operation within refrigeration and air conditioning, and United Refrigeration&rsquo;s refrigeration wholesale operation in France and the United Kingdom, accounted for the majority of the sales increase. Other acquisitions during the year also affected sales positively. Organic growth for the fourth quarter amounted to approximately five per cent. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">During the year, the organic volume increase comprised all markets in which G &amp; L Beijer operates. Sales in the Nordic market developed as they did for the Group as a whole. Southern Europe, including France, Italy and Spain, reported slightly stronger growth whilst the development in the United Kingdom and Central Europe was somewhat weaker. Eastern Europe reported very strong growth, albeit from lower levels. In South Africa, the development was also positive with strong growth. The acquisitions of Carrier&rsquo;s refrigeration wholesale operation in Thailand and the Italian company, SCM Frigo, continued to develop very positively.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong>Results</strong><br />Consolidated operating profit for the full year rose by 26 per cent to SEK 432.5M (344.0). The result improvement is explained by increased sales volumes, acquisitions and continued strict cost control. Operating profit for the fourth quarter increased by 50 per cent to SEK 120.2M (80.1). The increase is due to increased volume and synergy effects from acquisitions. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">The Group&rsquo;s financial income/expense for the full year amounted to SEK 55.4M (1.0) and to SEK -0.1M (-0.5) for the fourth quarter. Financial income/expense includes the capital gain of SEK 51.7M (0) from the divestment of shares in Beijer Alma and a share in profits of associated companies of SEK 12.7M (8.0) for the full year. The fourth quarter included a share in profits of SEK 1.5M (2.0).</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Profit before taxes increased to SEK 487.9M (345.0) for the full year. Profit for the fourth quarter increased to SEK 120.1M (79.6). Profit after tax amounted to SEK 374.1M (258.7) for the full year and to SEK 104.5M (61.1) for the fourth quarter. Profit per share amounted to SEK 16.98 (18.85) for the full year. Excluding the capital gain, profit per share amounted to SEK 15.19 (12.25). </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong>Dividend</strong><br />The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual Meeting of shareholders resolves that a dividend of SEK 9.00 (8.00) per share shall be paid for the 2011 financial year. This is equivalent to a total of SEK 190.8M if the shares currently held by the company are excluded. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong>Split</strong><br />The Board of Directors proposes that the 2012 Annual Meeting of Shareholders resolves upon a share split 2:1 aimed at improving the liquidity in the share. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong>Other financial information</strong><br />Consolidated capital expenditure including acquisitions amounted to SEK 991.6M (36.3) for the 2011 full year. Liquid funds, including unutilised bank overdraft facilities, were SEK 677.2M (478.4) at the year end. Shareholders&rsquo; equity amounted to SEK 2,433.4M (2,358.7). Net indebtedness amounted to SEK 1,141.1M (395.4). The equity ratio was 47.8 per cent (59.4). The average number of employees during the year was 1,945 (1,657). </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong>Significant events</strong><br />At the end of 2010, G &amp; L Beijer acquired the assets in Carrier Corporation&rsquo;s refrigeration wholesale operation in Thailand. During the first quarter of 2011, G &amp; L Beijer acquired the Italian SCM Frigo group. SCM Frigo designs, develops and builds chillers. Initially, G &amp; L Beijer acquired 51 per cent of the shares in SCM Frigo with an option to acquire the remaining 49 per cent. Both companies are included in G &amp; L Beijer&rsquo;s accounts from 1 January 2011.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">During the first quarter, G &amp; L Beijer divested its entire holding of 2.7 million shares in Beijer Alma, equivalent to 9.0 per cent of capital and 4.5 per cent of votes. The divestment generated sales proceeds of approximately SEK 365M and G &amp; L Beijer made a capital gain of SEK 51.7M. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">In September, G &amp; L Beijer completed its acquisition of Toshiba&rsquo;s distribution operation within refrigeration, heating and air conditioning in eleven European countries from Carrier Corporation. As a result, G &amp; L Beijer strengthens its positions in the European market. The transaction meant that Carrier transferred staff and net assets to G &amp; L Beijer. The operation has around 160 employees. The acquired operation is included in G &amp; L Beijer&rsquo;s accounts from 1 October 2011. The total consideration amounted to SEK 620M. The acquired net assets, which mainly consist of stock items and operating liabilities, amounted to SEK 200M and the surplus value was SEK 420M. The majority of the surplus value is deemed to be tax-deductible and is being further investigated. During 2011, the acquisition affected consolidated net sales by approximately SEK 242M. The acquisition would have affected consolidated net sales by approximately SEK 1,170M had it been included in the Group for the full year. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">During the fourth quarter, G &amp; L Beijer completed its acquisition of United Refrigeration&rsquo;s refrigeration wholesale operations in France and the United Kingdom. With the acquisitions, G &amp; L Beijer strengthens its position further in the French and British markets. The acquisition included two companies, the French company, Cofriset, and the British company, United Refrigeration (UK) Ltd. The acquired companies are included in the consolidated accounts from 1 October 2011. The total consideration for the acquisitions amounted to SEK 167M. The acquired net assets, which mainly consist of stock, trade debtors and operating liabilities, amounted to SEK 74M, which means a surplus value of SEK 93M. The majority of the surplus value consists of goodwill and is not tax-deductible. During 2011, the acquisitions affected the Group&rsquo;s net sales by SEK 140M. The acquisitions would have affected consolidated net sales by approximately SEK 618M had they been included for the full year. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">In November, G &amp; L Beijer carried out two acquisitions in South Africa and Mozambique which strengthens the Group&rsquo;s position in southern Africa. In South Africa, 100 per cent of Phoenix Racks (Pty) Ltd was acquired. Phoenix Racks manufactures customer-adapted refrigeration units. The company reports annual sales of approximately SEK 35M and has 23 employees. In Mozambique, G &amp; L Beijer acquired a newly-formed company which had acquired the assets in the company, Logos Industrias. Logos Industrias carries out refrigeration wholesale operations and is a distri&shy;butor of products manufactured by G &amp; L Beijer&rsquo;s South African operation. The company reports sales of approximately SEK 15M and has five employees. Initially, G &amp; L Beijer acquired 40 per cent of the newly-formed company with an option to acquire the remaining 60 per cent within 24 months. The companies are included in the consolidated accounts from the fourth quarter of 2011. The total conside&shy;ration for the acquisitions amounted SEK 17.3M and has had only a marginal effect on the Group&rsquo;s net sales and results during 2011. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">At the end of the year, G &amp; L Beijer divested the operation in its Swedish subsidiary, Asarum Industriaktiebolag (AIA), to the Italian LU-VE Group. At the same time, G &amp; L Beijer entered into a global collaboration agreement with LU-VE to distribute its products. The divestment of AIA was a step forward in G &amp; L Beijer&rsquo;s strategy to consolidate its operation into distribution of products within refrigeration and air conditioning. AIA&rsquo;s main operation is the production of heat exchangers. The company reports sales of approximately SEK 100M and has 75 employees. G &amp; L Beijer&rsquo;s sales will reduce by around SEK 50M net. Profit per share will be marginally affected positively during 2012. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">After the end of the financial year, G &amp; L Beijer acquired the Norwegian company, Ecofrigo, in January 2012. The company is project oriented within distribution of environment-friendly chillers and refrigerants. Ecofrigo reports sales of approximately SEK 35M and the company has six employees. The acquisition is expected to have a marginal positive effect on G &amp; L Beijer&rsquo;s profit per share. Ecofrigo is included in G &amp; L Beijer&rsquo;s accounts from January 2012.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong>Risk assessment</strong><br />The operations of the G &amp; L Beijer Group are affected by a number of external factors, the effects of which on the Group&rsquo;s operating profit can be controlled to a varying degree. The Group&rsquo;s operations are dependent on the general economic trend, especially in Europe, which controls the demand for G &amp; L Beijer&rsquo;s products and services. Acquisitions are normally linked with risks, for example staff defection. Other operating risks, such as agency and supplier agreements, product responsibility and delivery undertaking, technical develop&shy;ment, warranties, dependence on indivi&shy;duals, etc, are continually being analysed and, when necessary, action is taken to reduce the Group&rsquo;s risk exposure. In its operations, G &amp; L Beijer is exposed to financial risks such as currency risk, interest risk and liquidity risk. The parent company&rsquo;s risk picture is the same as that of the Group.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong>Financial information</strong><br />- The Annual Report for 2011 will be published in April 2012.<br />- The Three-Month Report for 2012 will be published on 25 April 2012.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><strong></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">G &amp; L Beijer AB is acquiring the Norwegian company, Ecofrigo AS, a project-oriented distribution company operating mainly within project planning and the distribution of environment friendly chillers and refrigerants. Ecofrigo reports sales of approximately SEK 35M with good profitability. The company has six employees.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">The acquisition complements G &amp; L Beijer&rsquo;s existing operation both geographically and from a product viewpoint. Ecofrigo was founded in December 2009 and has in a short time established a strong position in the Norwegian market. The company delivers environment friendly refrigeration units equipped with the latest technology from G &amp; L Beijer&rsquo;s Italian subsidiary, SCM Frigo. G &amp; L Beijer acquired SCM Frigo at the beginning of 2011 and the acquisition of Ecofrigo means a further strengthening of the synergies.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">In the acquisition of Ecofrigo, G &amp; L Beijer has identified a number of synergy effects, mainly on the purchasing side. The acquisition is expected to have a marginally positive effect on G &amp; L Beijer&rsquo;s profit per share. Ecofrigo is included in G &amp; L Beijer&rsquo;s accounts from January 2012.</span> <span style="font-size: 11pt"> </span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><strong></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong></strong>G &amp; L Beijer AB divests its business in the Swedish subsidiary, Asarum Industriaktiebolag (AIA), to the Italian LU-VE Group. At the same time, G &amp; L Beijer enters into a global collaboration agreement with LU-VE to distribute their products. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">The divestment of AIA is a step forward in G &amp; L Beijer&rsquo;s strategy to consolidate its operation into distribution of products within refrigeration and air condition. AIA&rsquo;s main operation is the production of heat exchangers. The company reports sales of SEK 100M and has 75 employees. Approximately 50 per cent of AIA&rsquo;s sales are made through G &amp; L Beijer&rsquo;s distribution network and the remaining 50 per cent through AIA&rsquo;s own sales organisation.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">The Italian LU-VE Group is one of Europe&rsquo;s largest manufacturers of heat exchangers. The group reports sales of approximately SEK 2 billion and has around 1,250 employees. LU-VE&rsquo;s products are being sold in 90 countries around the world. LU-VE is at the forefront of the development of new environment friendly technical solutions. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">G &amp; L Beijer currently distributes LU-VE&rsquo;s products in certain markets. As a result of the transaction this collaboration is further strengthened. The collaboration agreement means that G &amp; L Beijer will distribute LU-VE&rsquo;s commercial refrigeration products on an exclusive and global basis on selected markets. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">The transaction will be carried out at 30 December 2011. As a result of the divestment, G &amp; L Beijer&rsquo;s sales will reduce by around SEK 50M. Profit per share will be marginally positively affected during 2012. </span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><strong></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">G &amp; L Beijer AB has strengthened its position in southern Africa through two acquisitions, one in South Africa and one in Mozambique. The acquisitions will contribute total annual sales of approximately SEK 50M to the Group. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">In South Africa, G &amp; L Beijer has acquired Phoenix Racks (Pty) Ltd which designs, develops and builds customer-adapted refrigeration units. The company reports annual sales of approximately SEK 35M and has 23 employees. Phoenix Racks is a leading producer of environmentally friendly solutions for refrigeration units. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Phoenix Racks complements G &amp; L Beijer&rsquo;s existing operation in South Africa and strengthens the Group&rsquo;s total customer offer. Phoenix Racks gains access to G &amp; L Beijer&rsquo;s distribution network with 22 branches in South Africa. This creates good opportunities for additional sales and enables G &amp; L Beijer to increase its product range. There are also cost synergies on the purchasing side. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">The establishment of the operation in Mozambique is made through a newly formed company which acquires the assets in the company, Logos Industrias. Logos Industrias is a refrigeration wholesaler and a distributor of products manufactured by G &amp; L Beijer&rsquo;s South African operation. The company reports sales of approximately SEK 15M and has 5 employees. Initially, G &amp; L Beijer acquires 40 per cent of the shares in the newly formed company with an option to acquire the remaining 60 per cent within 24 months. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">The Group already has operations in South Africa, Botswana and Namibia. After the acquisitions, G &amp; L Beijer&rsquo;s annual sales in southern Africa amount to more than SEK 700M with good profitability. This is equivalent to around 10 per cent of the Group&rsquo;s total sales. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">The acquisitions are expected to have a marginal positive effect on G &amp; L Beijer&rsquo;s profit per share. The acquired companies will be included in the consolidated accounts from the fourth quarter of 2011. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><em><br />Malm&ouml;, 3 November 2011<br />G &amp; L Beijer AB (publ)<br /><br /></em><em></em></span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><strong></strong></p><p><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt">- Net sales increased by nine per cent to SEK 4,216.3M (3,866.2).</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt">- Operating profit rose by 18 per cent to SEK 312.3M (263.8).</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt">- Net profit for the period increased to SEK 269.6M (197.6) including the capital gain of SEK 51.7M from the divestment of shares in Beijer Alma.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt">- Profit per share amounted to SEK 12.40 (15.92). Excluding the capital gain, profit per share amounted to SEK 10.60 (9.32).</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt">- The acquisition of Toshiba&rsquo;s distribution operation in eleven European countries was completed after the end of the quarter. </span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt">- The acquisition of United Refrigeration&rsquo;s operation in France and the United Kingdom was completed after the end of the quarter.</span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;<br />G &amp; L Beijer is a technology-oriented trading Group which, through a combination of added-value agency products and products of the company&rsquo;s own development, offers competitive solutions for its customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt">In the previous year, operations were consolidated into comprising only products within refrigeration and air conditioning.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong>Sales<br /></strong></span><span style="font-size: 10pt">The Group continued to enjoy stable growth. Sales for the first nine months of the year increased by nine per cent to SEK 4,216.3M (3866.2). Organically, sales increased by approximately seven per cent. The previous acquisitions of SCM Frigo and the operation in Thailand contributed positively to sales whilst the stronger Swedish currency had a negative effect. At the end of the first quarter of 2010, the Beijer Tech business area was divested, which means that Beijer Tech&rsquo;s sales and results are not included in the comparative figures for 2010. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt">Sales for the third quarter increased by five per cent to SEK 1,474.8M (1,410.6). The third quarter was affected by weak demand at the beginning of the period, mainly as a result of the cold weather. For the remainder of the period, sales reverted to the corresponding levels of increase as earlier in the year. In spite of lower demand at the beginning of the quarter, organic growth amounted to 0.5 per cent for the third quarter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt">Organic growth for the first nine months of the year was extensive and comprised all markets in which G &amp; L Beijer operates. Southern Europe including France, Italy and Spain continued to develop strongly as did South Africa. Demand in the Scandinavian countries, especially in Sweden, im&shy;proved gradually. The acquisitions, the wholesale refrigeration operation in Thailand and the Italian company, SCM Frigo, enjoyed a very positive development. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt">During the third quarter, G &amp; L Beijer was intensively involved with two significant acquisitions. The acquisition of Toshiba&rsquo;s distribution operation within refrigeration, heating and air conditioning in eleven European countries and the acquisition of United Refrigeration&rsquo;s operation in France and the United Kingdom were completed after the end of the quarter. The acquisitions report total annual sales of SEK 1.8 billion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt">The acquisitions of Toshiba&rsquo;s and United Refrigeration&rsquo;s operations, which are included in G &amp; L Beijer from the fourth quarter, involve significant contributions to consolidated sales. Based on a rolling twelve-month period until September 2011, G &amp; L Beijer&rsquo;s annual sales pro forma would have amounted to approximately SEK 7.2 billion. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong>Results<br /></strong></span><span style="font-size: 10pt">Consolidated operating profit for the first nine months increased by 18 per cent to SEK 312.3M (263.8). The result improvement is explained by rising volumes, acquisitions and continued strict control of expenses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt">During the third quarter, operating profit fell slightly to SEK 114.5M (122.3). The fall is explained by the aforementioned weak demand at the beginning of the quarter. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt">The Group&rsquo;s financial income/expense amounted to SEK 55.5M (1.6) for the first three quarters and to SEK 5.2M (2.4) for the third quarter. Financial income/expense includes the capital gain from the divestment of shares in Beijer Alma, with SEK 51.7M (0) and a share in profits of associated companies of SEK 11.2M (6.0) for the nine-month period. The third quarter included a share in profits of associated companies of SEK 8.2M (2.0). </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt">Profit before taxes increased to SEK 367.8M (265.4) for the first nine months, of which SEK 119.6M (124.7) was for the third quarter. Profit after tax amounted to SEK 269.6M (197.6) for the nine-month period and to SEK 92.1M (91.4) for the third quarter. Profit per share amounted to SEK 12.40 (15.92) for the nine-month period. Excluding the capital gain, profit per share amounted to SEK 10.60 (9.32).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong>Other financial information<br /></strong></span><span style="font-size: 10pt">Consolidated capital expenditure including acquisitions amounted to SEK 111.7M (28.8) for the nine-month period. Liquid funds, including unutilised bank overdraft facilities, were SEK 576.1M (539.9) on 30 September 2011. Share&shy;holders&rsquo; equity amounted to SEK 2,385.5M (2,243.9). Net debt amounted to SEK 325.6M (461.6). The equity ratio was 57.5 per cent (53.8). The average number of employees during the period was 1,834 (1,682).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong>Significant events<br /></strong></span><span style="font-size: 10pt">During the first quarter, G &amp; L Beijer completed its acquisition of the Italian SCM Frigo group. SCM Frigo designs, develops and builds chillers. The company reports annual sales of approximately SEK 220M and has around 70 employees. Initially, G &amp; L Beijer acquired 51 per cent of the shares in SCM Frigo with an option to acquire the remaining 49 per cent. SCM Frigo is included in G &amp; L Beijer&rsquo;s accounts from 1 January 2011. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt">During the first quarter, G &amp; L Beijer divested its entire holding of 2.7 million shares in Beijer Alma, equivalent to 9.0 per cent of capital and 4.5 per cent of votes. The divestment generated sales proceeds of approximately SEK 365M and G &amp; L Beijer made a capital gain of SEK 51.7M before tax and SEK 38.1M after tax. The shares in Beijer Alma were received as part payment on the sale of Beijer Tech during the spring of 2010. The divestment of the shares was another step forward in creating increased scope to take action for the continued expansion within the strongly growing refrigeration wholesale operation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt">After the end of the reporting period, G &amp; L Beijer completed its acqui&shy;sition of Toshiba&rsquo;s distribution operation within refrigeration, heating and air conditioning in eleven European countries from Carrier Corporation. The transaction means that Carrier will transfer staff and assets to G &amp; L Beijer for a consideration of approximately EUR 86M (SEK 790M) on a debt-free basis. Sales for Toshiba&rsquo;s distribution operation in the countries involved amounted to EUR 130M (approxi&shy;mately SEK 1,200M) and the operating profit was EUR 9.6M (SEK 88M) for the latest twelve-month period until the end of the first quarter of 2011. The operation has 160 employees. The acquisition, which is made on a debt-free basis, is financed through own funds and increased borrowing. The acquired operation is included in G &amp; L Beijer&rsquo;s accounts from 1 October 2011. The acquisition is estimated to affect G &amp; L Beijer&rsquo;s profit per share positively by approximately SEK 2 on an annual basis. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt">After the end of the reporting period, G &amp; L Beijer completed its acquisition of United Refrigeration&rsquo;s refrige&shy;ration wholesale operations in France and the United Kingdom. The acquisition included two companies. The French company &ndash; Cofriset &ndash; reports sales equivalent to SEK 520M and has 125 employees. The British company &ndash; United Refrigeration (UK) Ltd &ndash; reports sales equivalent to SEK 90M and has 44 employees. In total, the two companies report sales equivalent to SEK 610M and have 169 employees. The total consideration for both companies amounts to approximately SEK 240M on a debt-free basis. The consideration is financed through own funds and increased borrowing. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt">With the acquisitions, G &amp; L Beijer strengthens its position still further in the French and British markets. The acquired companies sell products which correspond to G &amp; L Beijer&rsquo;s product range. The acquisition is expected to have a marginally positive effect on G &amp; L Beijer&rsquo;s profit per share. The acquired companies are included in the consolidated accounts from October 2011. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong>Risk assessment<br /></strong></span><span style="font-size: 10pt">The operations of the G &amp; L Beijer Group are affected by a number of external factors, the effects of which on the Group&rsquo;s operating profit can be controlled to a varying degree. The Group&rsquo;s operations are dependent on the general economic trend, especially in Europe, which controls the demand for G &amp; L Beijer&rsquo;s products and services. Acquisitions are normally linked with risks, for example staff defection. Other operating risks, such as agency and supplier agreements, product responsibility and delivery undertaking, technical develop&shy;ment, warranties, dependence on indivi&shy;duals, etc, are continually being analysed and, when necessary, action is taken to reduce the Group&rsquo;s risk exposure. In its operations, G &amp; L Beijer is exposed to financial risks such as currency risk, interest risk and liquidity risk. The parent company&rsquo;s risk picture is the same as that of the Group.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><strong></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">G &amp; L Beijer AB closes the transaction with Carrier Corporation regarding the Toshiba distribution operations for residential and light commercial heating and air conditioning products in 11 European countries. The transaction, as previously announced, means that Carrier transfers employees and assets to G &amp; L Beijer for consideration of approximately EUR 86M (SEK 790M) on a debt-free basis. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Sales for Toshiba&rsquo;s distribution operations in the countries involved amounted to EUR 130M (approximately SEK 1,200M) and operating profit amounted to EUR 9.6M (SEK 88M) for the latest 12-month period ending first quarter 2011. The operation has approximately 160 employees. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">The Toshiba distribution business will be included in G &amp; L Beijer&rsquo;s accounts beginning 1 October 2011. Based on a rolling twelve-month period up to and including June 2011, G &amp; L Beijer, including the acquired operation, would report pro forma sales of approximately 6,600M with an operating profit of around SEK 500M. The acquisition is estimated to affect G &amp; L Beijer&rsquo;s profit per share positively by approximately SEK 2 on an annual basis.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><strong></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">G &amp; L Beijer AB has signed the purchase agreement with Carrier Corporation to appoint G &amp; L Beijer as distributor and acquire Carrier&rsquo;s distribution operation for the residential and light commercial heating and air conditioning products of the Japanese company, Toshiba. The transaction as announced on 1 June 2011 means that Carrier will transfer employees and assets for a consideration of approximately EUR 86M (SEK 790M) on a debt-free basis. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Sales for Toshiba&rsquo;s distribution operation in the countries involved amounted to EUR 130M (approximately SEK 1,200M) and operating profit amounted to EUR 9.6M (SEK 88M) for the latest 12-month period until the end of the first quarter of 2011. The operation has around 160 employees. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">The acquired operation will be kept separate from G &amp; L Beijer&rsquo;s existing distribution operation from an operational viewpoint. Through a jointly-owned company with Toshiba, Carrier Corporation has the exclusive distribution rights outside Japan relating to Toshiba&rsquo;s products within the residential and light commercial heating, ventilation and air conditioning segment (HVAC) which are manufactured by the jointly owned company.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">G &amp; L Beijer has obtained a fairness opinion relating to the transaction and its terms and conditions from an independent external party.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size: 10pt">G &amp; L Beijer AB is acquiring United Refrigeration&rsquo;s refrigeration wholesale operations in France and the United Kingdom. United Refrigeration, which is one of the largest distributors of refrigeration products and comfort cooling systems in the USA, has decided to concentrate its operations on the North American market. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt">The acquisition refers to two companies. The French company &ndash; Cofriset &ndash; reports sales equivalent to SEK 520M and has 125 employees. The British company &ndash; United Refrigeration (UK) Ltd &ndash; reports sales equivalent to SEK 90M and employs 44. In total, the two companies report sales equivalent to SEK 610M and have 169 employees. The total consideration for both companies amounts to approximately SEK 240M on a debt-free basis.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt">With the acquisitions, G &amp; L Beijer strengthens its position still further in the French and British markets. The acquired companies sell products which correspond to G &amp; L Beijer&rsquo;s product range. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt">The synergy gains are primarily within purchasing and fixed costs. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt">G &amp; L Beijer&rsquo;s profit per share is deemed to be marginally positively affected. The acquisition is subject to approval by the French competition authorities. The acquired companies will be included in the consolidated accounts soon after the approval by the competition authorities. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt">The acquisition will be financed through own funds and increased borrowing.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt">- Net sales increased by 12 per cent to SEK 2,741.5M (2,455.6).</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt">- Operating profit rose by 40 per cent to SEK 197.8M (141.5).</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt">- Profit after tax increased to SEK 177.5M (106.2) including the capital gain of SEK 51.7M from the divestment of shares in Beijer Alma.</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt"></span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt">- Profit per share rose to SEK 8.19 (5.01). Excluding the capital gain, profit per share amounted to SEK 6.39 (5.01).</span></strong></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt">- Letter of intent to acquire Toshiba&rsquo;s distribution operations in eleven European countries. </span></strong></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt">G &amp; L Beijer is a technology-oriented trading Group which, through a combination of added-value agency products and products of the company&rsquo;s own development, offers competitive solutions for its customers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt">In the previous year, operations were consolidated into comprising only products within refrigeration and air conditioning. The operational activities as a whole are carried out under the name of Beijer Ref.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong>Sales<br /></strong></span><span style="font-size: 10pt">The positive trend from the first quarter was consolidated during the second quarter with strong growth and increased profit. Consolidated sales for the first six months of the year increased by 12 per cent to SEK 2,741.5M (2,455.6). Acquisitions contributed positively to sales whilst the stronger Swedish currency had a negative effect. Organically, sales increased by approximately 11 per cent. Sales for the second quarter increased by 11 per cent to SEK 1,473.0M (1,325.7). Organically, the increase was 10 per cent. At the end of the first quarter of 2010, the Beijer Tech business area was divested, which means that Beijer Tech&rsquo;s sales and results are not included in the comparative figures for 2010.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt">The organic growth remains extensive and comprises virtually all markets in which G &amp; L Beijer operates.France, which is the Group&rsquo;s largest individual market, developed especially strongly as didItalyandSpain.South Africa,FinlandandThailandalso developed very positively.United KingdomandCentral Europereported good growth.Eastern Europerecovered strongly, albeit from low levels. In comparison with the other markets, the Scandinavian market did not show the same strength. However, the Swedish operation had a large backlog of orders at the end of the reporting period.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong>Results<br /></strong></span><span style="font-size: 10pt">Consolidated operating profit for the first six months increased by 40 per cent to SEK 197.8M (141.5). Operating profit for the second quarter rose by 24 per cent to SEK 125.6M (101.0). The result improvement is explained by rising volumes, acquisitions and continued strict cost control.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt">The Group&rsquo;s financial income/expense amounted to SEK 50.3M (-0.8) for the first half of the year, of which SEK 0.3M (-0.8) for the second quarter. Financial income/expense includes the capital gain from the divestment of shares in Beijer Alma, with SEK 51.7M (0) and a share in profits of associated companies of SEK 3.0M (4.0) for the six-month period. The second quarter included a share in profits of associated companies of SEK 1.5M (2.0).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt">Profit before taxes increased to SEK 248.1M (140.7) for the first half of the year, including the capital gain, of which SEK 125.9M (100.2) was for the second quarter. Profit after tax amounted to SEK 177.5M (106.2) for the half year and to SEK 89.7M (77.5) for the second quarter. Profit per share increased to SEK 8.19 (5.01) for the first six months. Excluding the capital gain, profit per share amounted to SEK 6.39 (5.01).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong>Other financial information<br /></strong></span><span style="font-size: 10pt">Consolidated capital expenditure including acquisitions amounted to SEK 97.8M (13.4) for the first half of the year. Liquid funds, including unutilised bank overdraft facilities, were SEK 525.7M (436.2) on 30 June 2011. Shareholders&rsquo; equity amounted to SEK 2,302.2M (2,190.1). Net indebtedness amounted to SEK 372.9M (542.6). The equity ratio was 55.0 per cent (51.9). The average number of employees during the period was 1,817 (1,674).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong>Significant events<br /></strong></span><span style="font-size: 10pt">During the first quarter, G &amp; L Beijer completed its acquisition of the Italian SCM Frigo group. SCM Frigo designs, develops and builds chillers. The company reports annual sales of approximately SEK 220M and has 70 employees. Initially, G &amp; L Beijer acquired 51 per cent of the shares in SCM Frigo with an option to acquire the remaining 49 per cent. SCM Frigo is included in G &amp; L Beijer&rsquo;s accounts from 1 January 2011.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt">During the first quarter, G &amp; L Beijer divested its entire holding of 2.7 million shares in Beijer Alma, equivalent to 9.0 per cent of capital and 4.5 per cent of votes. The divestment of the shares generated sales proceeds of approximately SEK 365M and G &amp; L Beijer made a capital gain of SEK 51.7M before tax and SEK 38.1M after tax. The shares in Beijer Alma were received as part payment on the sale of Beijer Tech during the spring of 2010. The divestment of the shares was another step forward in creating increased scope to take action for the continued expansion within the strongly growing refrigeration wholesale operation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt">In June, G &amp; L Beijer signed a letter of intent with Carrier Corporation to acquire the distribution operation for Toshiba&rsquo;s products within the refrigeration, heating and air-conditioning segment in eleven European countries. Carrier Corporation, though a jointly-owned company with Toshiba, has the exclusive distribution rights for Toshiba&rsquo;s products within the heating, ventilation and air-conditioning segment (HVAC) outsideJapan. The transaction means that Carrier will transfer staff and assets related to Toshiba&rsquo;s operation to G &amp; L Beijer. The price for the acquisition amounts to nine times the operation&rsquo;s annual operating profit. For the latest twelve-month period until the end of the first quarter of 2011, sales of Toshiba&rsquo;s distributor operation in the countries involved amounted to approximately EUR 130M (around SEK 1,200M) and operating profit to approximately EUR 10M (around SEK 93M). The addition of the Toshiba distribution operations is expected to increase profit per share by SEK 2.09 on a yearly basis. The final purchase price is subject to a due-diligence process and a mutual agreement between the parties.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt">The acquisition is important for G &amp; L Beijer from several aspects. Air conditioning and heating are growth areas driven by an increased need for energy savings and greater consideration for the environment. Through its distribution capacity and organisation, G &amp; L Beijer can significantly increase Toshiba&rsquo;s sales and, at the same time, benefit from an increased size and expanded product portfolio. Carrier&rsquo;s distribution of Toshiba&rsquo;s products comprises sales in eleven European markets;Germany,France,Spain,Portugal,Italy,Sweden,Finland,Polandand the threeBaltic States. The distribution rights in the countries involved are exclusive. Assets relating to the operation and approximately 160 employees will be transferred. G &amp; L Beijer can take advantage of its strong balance sheet as the acquisition, which is made on a debt free basis, will be financed with own funds and increased borrowing.</span></p>
<p></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt">The transaction is subject to the customary due diligence processes and to the parties reaching a final purchase agreement, which is expected to be signed during the third quarter of 2011. The completion of the transaction is also subject to obtaining regulatory clearance if required. Carrier Corporation, which is G &amp; L Beijer&rsquo;s largest individual shareholder with 41.4 per cent of capital and 33.3 per cent of votes, has two representatives on the G &amp; L Beijer Board of Directors. The transaction is, therefore, classified as a related-party transaction and the Board Members who represent Carrier are not participating in the Board of Directors&rsquo; handling of the acquisition. In addition, G &amp; L Beijer will obtain a fairness opinion relating to the transaction and its terms from an independent external party.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong>Risk assessment<br /></strong></span><span style="font-size: 10pt">The operations of the G &amp; L Beijer Group are affected by a number of external factors, the effects of which on the Group&rsquo;s operating profit can be controlled to a varying degree. The Group&rsquo;s operations are dependent on the general economic trend, especially inEurope, which controls the demand for G &amp; L Beijer&rsquo;s products and services. Acquisitions are normally linked with risks, for example staff defection. Other operating risks, such as agency and supplier agreements, product responsibility and delivery undertaking, technical development, warranties, dependence on individuals, etc, are continually being analysed and, when necessary, action is taken to reduce the Group&rsquo;s risk exposure. In its operations, G &amp; L Beijer is exposed to financial risks such as currency risk, interest risk and liquidity risk. The parent company&rsquo;s risk picture is the same as that of the Group.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong></p><p><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">G &amp; L Beijer AB and Carrier Corporation have signed a letter of intent to appoint G &amp; L Beijer as the distributor of Toshiba brand residential and light commercial heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) products in 11 European countries. As part of this transaction, Carrier will transfer employees and contribute existing assets related to the distribution of Toshiba brand HVAC products to G &amp; L Beijer in exchange for a cash amount equal to nine times annualized EBIT. In the trailing 12 month period ending Q1, 2011, Carrier&rsquo;s Toshiba brand distribution operations in these countries had approximately 160 employees, sales of approximately EUR 130M (SEK 1,200M) and EBIT of approximately EUR 10M (SEK 93M). The final EBIT is subject to due diligence confirmation and mutual agreement between the two parties. The Toshiba brand distribution operations will be maintained as a standalone operational division within G &amp; L Beijer separate from the Beijer Refrigeration operations. Carrier Corporation, through its joint venture with Toshiba Corporation, has exclusive distribution rights outside of Japan for Toshiba brand HVAC products manufactured by the joint venture.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"> </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><em>&rdquo;For G &amp; L Beijer, this is a strategic opportunity from several aspects. Air conditioning and heat pumps are priority growth areas, which are driven by an increased requirement for energy savings and greater consideration for the environment. G &amp; L Beijer can bring its distribution capabilities to significantly enhance Toshiba sales while benefiting from expansion and diversification of its portfolio&rdquo; says Joen Magnusson, CEO of G &amp; L Beijer.</em> </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"> </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Toshiba is a premier brand known for high-quality air-conditioning equipment. The company&rsquo;s product development focuses on increased energy efficiency, consideration for the environment and high comfort level. G &amp; L Beijer, with its strong distribution expertise and market presence, intends to invest in the Toshiba brand and thus enhance services to customers and grow Toshiba HVAC sales. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"> </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">The addition of the Toshiba brand distribution operations expands the Group&rsquo;s operations to Germany and strengthens G &amp; L Beijer&rsquo;s position within air-conditioning and heat pumps in Europe, a higher growth market than commercial refrigeration. Higher energy prices have increased demand for more energy-efficient solutions and higher living standards continue to generate strong demands for comfort cooling. It means that the proportion of air-conditioning and heat pumps rises from around 20 to approximately 35 per cent of G &amp; L Beijer&rsquo;s total sales.&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"> </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Carrier&rsquo;s Toshiba brand distribution operations comprise sales in eleven European markets: Germany, France, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Sweden, Finland, Poland and the three Baltic States. The distribution rights in these countries will be exclusive. The assets related to these operations, along with approximately 160 employees, will be transferred to G &amp; L Beijer. From an operational viewpoint, the operations will form a separate business unit within G &amp; L Beijer.</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"> </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Carrier&rsquo;s Toshiba brand distribution operations complement G &amp; L Beijer&rsquo;s existing operations in Europe. At the same time, the combination strengthens G &amp; L Beijer&rsquo;s competitiveness in its markets with an extended product offering and expanded distribution network.&nbsp; Based on its 2010 accounts, G &amp; L Beijer will report pro forma sales of approximately SEK 6,400M with an operating profit of SEK 445M. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"> </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">G &amp; L Beijer can take advantage of its strong balance sheet and the transaction, made on a debt-free basis, is financed with own funds and increased borrowing. The addition of the Toshiba distribution operations is expected to increase profit per share by SEK 2.09 on a yearly basis. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"> </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">The transaction is subject to a customary due diligence process and finalizing the purchase agreement, which is expected to be signed no later than the third quarter of 2011. The completion of the transaction is also subject to obtaining required regulatory clearance. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"> </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Carrier Corporation, which is G &amp; L Beijer&rsquo;s largest individual shareholder with 41.4 per cent of capital and 33.3 per cent of votes, has two representatives on the G &amp; L Beijer Board of Directors. The transaction is, therefore, classified as a related-party transaction and the Board Members who represent Carrier are not participating in the Board of Directors&rsquo; review and approval of the transaction. In addition, G &amp; L Beijer will obtain a fairness opinion relating to the transaction. </span></span></p>

The operational activities as a whole are carried out within the Beijer Ref business area. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"> </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><strong>Sales</strong></span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"> </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">The G &amp; L Beijer Group reported a strong first quarter regarding both sales and profit. Consolidated sales increased by 12 per cent to SEK 1,268.5M (1,129.9) for the quarter. Acquisitions contributed positively to sales whilst the stronger Swedish currency had a negative effect. When adjusted for currencies, sales increased by 22 per cent during the period. Excluding acquisitions and currency effects, sales rose by 13 per cent. At the end of the first quarter of 2010, the Beijer Tech business area was divested, which means that Beijer Tech&rsquo;s sales and results are not included in the comparative figures for 2010.&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"> </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">The organic growth is extensive and comprises virtually all markets in which G &amp; L Beijer operates. France, which is G &amp; L Beijer&rsquo;s largest individual market, developed especially strongly. It meant that Southern Europe reported organic growth of approxi&shy;mately 15 per cent. The Nordic countries and United Kingdom grew organically by 10 per cent whilst Western Europe and South Africa grew by 8 per cent each. Eastern Europe reported organic growth of nearly 80 per cent, albeit from low levels.&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"> </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">The most recent acquisitions, Carrier&rsquo;s refrigeration wholesale operation in Thailand and the Italian SCM Frigo group, enjoyed organic growth of 30 per cent and 25 per cent respectively during the quarter. The integration process is proceeding according to plan.&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Consolidated operating profit rose by 79 per cent to SEK 72.3M (40.5). The result improvement is explained by increased sales volumes and continued strict control of expenses. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"> </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">During the first quarter of 2011, the shares received as part payment for Beijer Tech were divested. The sales proceeds amounted to SEK 365M. The capital gain was SEK 51.7M.&nbsp; </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"> </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">The Group&rsquo;s financial income/expense amounted to SEK 50.0M (0.1). Financial income/expense includes the capital gain from the divestment of the shares in Beijer Alma and a share in profits of associated companies of SEK 1.5M (2.0). Profit before taxes amounted to SEK 122.3M (40.6). Profit after tax amounted to SEK 87.8M (28.7). Profit per share amounted to SEK 4.05 (1.36). Excluding the capital gain, profit per share was SEK 2.25 (1.36). </span></span></p>

Liquid funds, including unutilised bank overdraft facilities, were SEK 717.0M (498.3). Shareholders&rsquo; equity amounted to SEK 2,322.2M (2,279.3). Net indebtedness amounted to SEK 143.6M (376.1). The equity ratio was 59.8 per cent (57.8). The average number of employees during the period was 1,823 (1,658).</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">During the quarter, G &amp; L Beijer completed its acqui&shy;sition of the Italian SCM Frigo group. SCM Frigo designs, develops and builds chillers. The company re&shy;&shy;ports annual sales of approximately SEK 220M and has 70 employees. Initially, G &amp; L Beijer acquired 51 per cent of the shares in SCM Frigo with an option to acquire the remaining 49 per cent. SCM Frigo is included in G &amp; L Beijer&rsquo;s accounts from 1 January 2011. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"> </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">During the quarter, G &amp; L Beijer divested its entire holding of 2.7 million shares in Beijer Alma, equivalent to 9.0 per cent of capital and 4.5 per cent of votes. The divestment generated sales proceeds of approximately SEK 365M and G &amp; L Beijer made a capital gain of SEK 51.7M before tax and SEK 38.1M after tax. The shares in Beijer Alma were received as part payment on the sale of Beijer Tech during the spring of 2010. The divestment of the shares was another step forward in creating increased scope to take action for the continued expansion within the strongly growing refrige&shy;ration wholesale operation.&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"> </span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10pt"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">The operations of the G &amp; L Beijer Group are affected by a number of external factors, the effects of which on the Group&rsquo;s operating profit can be controlled to a varying degree. The Group&rsquo;s operations are dependent on the general economic trend, especially in Europe, which controls the demand for G &amp; L Beijer&rsquo;s products and services. Acquisitions are normally linked with risks, for example staff defection. Other operating risks such as agency and supplier agreements, product responsibility and delivery undertaking, technical development, warranties, dependence on individuals, etc, are continually being analysed and, when necessary, action is taken to reduce the Group&rsquo;s risk exposure. In its operations, G &amp; L Beijer is exposed to financial risks such as currency risk, interest risk and liquidity risk. The parent company&rsquo;s risk picture is the same as that of the Group.</span></span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Net sales amounted to SEK 5,006.1M (5,215.0).</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Operating profit before one-time items amounted to SEK 313.0M (331.2). Including one-time items, profit for the first three quarters of 2013 was SEK 278.8M.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Net profit for the period excluding one-time items amounted to SEK 208.0M (234.3). Including one-time items, net profit for the period was SEK 183.0M (256.3).</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Profit per share excluding one-time items amounted to SEK 4.72 (5.34) and to SEK 4.13 (5.86) including one-time items.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Strong third quarter with a six per cent growth in sales compared with the corresponding quarter in the previous year. Operating profit increased by 20 per cent for the same period.<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />G &amp; L Beijer is a technology-oriented trading Group which, through a combination of added-value agency products and products of the company&rsquo;s own development, offers competitive solutions within refrigeration and air conditioning.<strong><br /></strong></span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong>Sales</strong><br />G &amp; L Beijer enjoyed a strong development during the third quarter of 2013, both when compared with the corresponding quarter in the previous year and with the previous quarters of the current year. The third quarter of 2013 was the Group&rsquo;s best individual quarter so far with regard to both sales and results for the current operation.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Accumulated, consolidated sales are currently four per cent lower than for the corresponding period in the previous year, SEK 5,006.1M (5,215.0). When adjusted for currency effects as a result of the strong SEK, sales were unchanged compared with the same period in the previous year.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Sales for the third quarter increased by approximately six per cent to SEK 1,830.4M (1,733.9). Currency effects affected sales marginally during the period. The warm weather in Europe during the summer favoured Group sales. The increased sales for the third quarter broke a negative trend of five quarters, characterised by weak demand in Europe.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">The increase for the quarter comprised all regions and virtually all countries in which the Group operates. The Nordic countries reported strong development as did the United Kingdom and Ireland. Southern and eastern Europe have stabilised and also increased their sales. In central Europe sales turned and showed growth. As earlier in the year, Southern Africa and Asia continued to enjoy strong volume growth.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong>Results</strong><br />Consolidated operating profit excluding one-time items of SEK 34.2M amounted to SEK 313.0M (331.2) for the nine-month period. Including one-time items, operating profit was SEK 278.8M for 2013. Operating profit for the third quarter increased by 21 per cent to SEK 146.7M (121.1) compared with the corresponding period in the previous year. The improved result for the third quarter is explained by increased sales volumes and positive effects from the structural measures initiated during the second quarter. The measures, which generate gradual effects, are expected to produce total annual savings of approximately SEK 25M.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">The Group&rsquo;s financial income/expense was SEK -23.8M (-2.3) for the first nine months. Financial income/expense in 2012 included a capital gain of SEK 22.0M from the divestment of a participation in an associated company. Financial income/expense for the third quarter was SEK -8.8M (-10.1). Profit before tax amounted to SEK 255.0M (328.9) for the first three quarters and to SEK 137.9M (111.0) for the third quarter. Profit after tax was SEK 183.0M (256.3) for the nine-month period and SEK 100.2M (83.9) for the third quarter. Profit per share amounted to SEK 4.13 (5.86) for the nine-month period. Excluding one-time items, profit per share was SEK 4.72 (5.34) for the same period.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong>Other financial information</strong><br />Consolidated capital expenditure, including acqui&shy;sitions, amounted to SEK 41.2M (69.1) for the first </span><span style="font-size: 10pt">three quarters. Liquid funds, including unutilised bank overdraft facilities, were SEK 513.1M (469.5) on 30 </span><span style="font-size: 10pt">September 2013. Shareholders&rsquo; equity amounted to SEK 2,305.1M (2,340.4). The net debt was SEK 1,302.2M (1,324.4). The equity ratio amounted to 44.0 per cent (44.3). The average number of employees during the </span><span style="font-size: 10pt">period was 2,119 (2,127).</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong>Significant events</strong><br />In April, G &amp; L Beijer acquired the Danish refrigeration wholesaler, FK Teknik, which reported sales of approximately SEK 32M in 2012 and showed good profita&shy;bility. The company, founded in 1956, enjoys a very good reputation in the market. FK Teknik has five employees. The acquisition is a step forward in a consolidation of the Danish market. G &amp; L Beijer already has a strong position through its existing operation in Denmark. The acquisition is deemed to have a marginal positive effect on G &amp; L Beijer&rsquo;s profit per share. FK Teknik is included in G &amp; L Beijer&rsquo;s accounts from 1 April 2013.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">In June, the Board of Directors appointed Per Bertland as the new Managing Director and CEO of G &amp; L Beijer. Per Bertland took up his duties on 1 July 2013. He has worked in different functions within the G &amp; L Beijer Group since 1990. He has been Head of the Beijer Ref business area and a Member of the Executive Management.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong>Risk assessment</strong><br />The operations of the G &amp; L Beijer Group are affected by a number of external factors, the effects of which on the Group&rsquo;s operating profit can be controlled to a varying degree. The Group&rsquo;s operations are dependent on the general economic trend, especially in Europe, which controls the demand for G &amp; L Beijer&rsquo;s products</span><span style="font-size: 10pt"> and services. Acquisitions are normally linked with risks such as, for example, staff defection. Other operating risks, such as agency and supplier agreements, product responsibility and delivery undertaking, technical develop&shy;ment, warranties, dependence on individuals, etc., are continually being analysed and, when necessary, action is taken to reduce the Group&rsquo;s risk exposure. In its operations, G &amp; L Beijer is exposed to financial risks such as currency risk, interest risk and liquidity risk. The parent company&rsquo;s risk picture is the same as that of the Group.

<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">- Operating profit before one-time items was SEK 166.3M (210.1). Including one-time costs, operating profit was SEK 132.1M for the first half of 2013.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">- Profit for the period excluding one-time items amounted to SEK 107.8M (150.4). Including one-time items, profit for the period was SEK 82.8M (172.4).</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">- Profit per share amounted to SEK 2.42 (3.42) excluding one-time items and to SEK 1.83 (3.94) including one-time items.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">- Per Bertland appointed as the new Managing Director and CEO.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">G &amp; L Beijer is a technology-oriented trading Group which, through a combination of added-value agency products and products of the company&rsquo;s own development, offers competitive solutions within refrigeration and air conditioning.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong>Sales</strong><br />G &amp; L Beijer showed a better development during the second quarter of 2013 compared with the first </span><span style="font-size: 10pt">quarter. However, sales were affected negatively by currency effects as a result of the strong SEK. In addition, the spring was unusually cold in Europe which affected demand.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Consolidated sales fell by nine per cent to SEK 3,175.7M (3,481.1) for the first half of the year. When adjusted for currency effects, sales fell by four per cent. Sales for the second quarter fell by six per cent to SEK 1,711.9M (1,826.3) and by two per cent when adjusted for currency effects.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">The sales development varied between the Group&rsquo;s different regions. The Scandinavian countries and United Kingdom reported some recovery with rising sales volumes during the second quarter. Central Europe also reported a stabilisation with largely unchanged volumes. In southern and eastern Europe, sales volumes fell at the corresponding rate as in the first quarter. Southern Africa enjoyed strong volume growth.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong>Results</strong><br />Consolidated operating profit excluding one-time items of SEK 34.2M amounted to SEK 166.3M (210.1) for the first half of the year. Including one-time items, operating profit was SEK 132.1M for 2013. For the </span><br /><span style="font-size: 10pt"> second quarter, operating profit excluding one-time items amounted to SEK 117.6M (129.0). Including one-time items of SEK 34.2M charged to profit in the second quarter, operating profit was SEK 83.4M. The one-time items relate to costs for severance pay for the Managing Director of SEK 15.6M and structural measures of SEK 18.6M. The structural measures mainly comprise reductions of approximately 40 staff in Europe in order to meet lower demand. The measures are expected to generate annual savings of approxi&shy;mately SEK 25M with full effect from the third quarter.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Excluding one-time items, operating profit fell by nine per cent for the second quarter compared with a fall of 40 per cent for the first quarter and 21 per cent for the first six months as a whole.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">The Group&rsquo;s financial income/expense excluding one-time items amounted to SEK -15.0M (-14.2) for the first half of the year. Financial income/expense in 2012 included a capital gain of SEK 22.0M from the divestment of a participation in an associated company. Profit before tax amounted to SEK 117.1M (217.9). Profit after tax was SEK 82.8M (172.4). Profit per share amounted to SEK 1.83 (3.94). Excluding one-time items, profit per share was SEK 2.42 (3.42) for the first half of the year. Financial income/expense for the second quarter amounted to SEK -9.6M (-7.5). Profit before tax was SEK 73.8M (121.5) and profit after tax amounted to SEK 50.4M (93.0). Profit per share was SEK 1.14 (2.12). Excluding one-time items, profit per share was SEK 1.73 for the second quarter.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong>Other financial information</strong><br />Consolidated capital expenditure, including acquisitions, amounted to SEK 34.4M (55.1) for the first half of the year. Liquid funds, including unutilised bank overdraft facilities, were SEK 433.1M (491.9) on 30 June 2013. Shareholders&rsquo; equity amounted to SEK 2,247.5M (2,375.9). The net debt was SEK 1,479.3M (1,418.8). The equity ratio amounted to 41.7 per cent (42.4). The average number of employees during the period was 2,106 (2,120).</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span><strong></strong></span></p><p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">- Net sales amounted to SEK 1,463.8M (1,654.8).<br />- Operating profit was SEK 48.7M (81.1).<br />- The period&rsquo;s result excluding one-time items amounted to SEK 32.4M (57.3).<br />- Profit per share amounted to SEK 0.70 (1.30) excluding one-time items.<br />- Acquisition of the Danish company, FK Teknik A/S, after the end of the reporting period.<br /><br />G &amp; L Beijer is a technology-oriented trading Group which, through a combination of added-value agency products and products of the company&rsquo;s own development, offers competitive solutions within refrigeration and air conditioning.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong>Sales</strong><br />G &amp; L Beijer&rsquo;s sales fell by 12 per cent to SEK 1,463.8M (1,654.8) for the first quarter. Exchange rate fluctuations, mainly as a result of the stronger SEK, affected sales negatively during the quarter compared with the previous year. Adjusted for this, sales fell by approximately six per cent. Fewer invoicing days, partly as Easter fell in March this year, also affected the comparative figures. Excluding the aforementioned effects, sales fell by approximately three per cent for the quarter. In addition, a lower world market price for refrigerants, as well as generally weaker demand in Europe, affected sales negatively. As a consequence, sales fell in all regions in Europe. However, the operations in southern Africa and Thailand developed positively with rising sales in the respective region.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">G &amp; L Beijer normally has a seasonal variation in sales and results with relatively stronger second and third quarters, whilst the first and fourth quarters are relatively weaker. The pattern was strengthened with the acquisition in 2011 of Toshiba&rsquo;s operation within air conditioning and heating in Europe.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong>Results</strong><br />Consolidated operating profit amounted to SEK 48.7M (81.1) for the first quarter. The decrease in operating profit is explained by lower sales volume and by currency effects on translation of foreign currency into SEK. At the same time, the previous year&rsquo;s savings programme has made an impact which has reduced the fall in profit. In addition, the first quarter of 2012 was a relatively strong period from a historic viewpoint.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">The Group&rsquo;s financial income/expense amounted to SEK -5.4M (15.3). Financial income/expense in 2012 included a capital gain of SEK 22.0M from the divestment of a participation in an associated company. Profit before tax amounted to SEK 43.3M (96.4). Excluding the capital gain, profit before tax for the first quarter of 2012 amounted to SEK 74.4M. Profit after tax was 32.4M (79.3). Excluding the capital gain, profit after tax for the first quarter of 2012 amounted to SEK 57.3M. Profit per share amounted to SEK 0.70 (1.82). Excluding the capital gain, profit per share was SEK 1.30 in 2012.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong>Other financial information</strong><br />Consolidated capital expenditure, including acquisitions, amounted to SEK 6.0M (39.7) for the first quarter of 2013. Liquid funds, including unutilised bank overdraft facilities, were SEK 629.1M (751.1) on 31 March 2013. Shareholders&rsquo; equity amounted to SEK 2,329.5M (2,454.0). The net debt was SEK 1,121.4M (1,104.5). The equity ratio amounted to 47.4 per cent (46.5). The average number of employees during the period was 2,116 (2,093).</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong>Significant events</strong><br />After the end of the reporting period, G &amp; L Beijer acquired the Danish refrigeration wholesaler, FK Teknik, which reported sales of approximately SEK 32M in 2012 and showed good profitability. The company, founded in 1956, enjoys a very good reputation in the market. FK Teknik has five employees. The acquisition was a step forward in the consolidation of the Danish market. G &amp; L Beijer already has a strong position through its existing operation in Denmark. With the acquisition, the position will be strengthened further. The acquisition is deemed to have a marginal positive effect on G &amp; L Beijer&rsquo;s profit per share. FK Teknik is included in G &amp; L Beijer&rsquo;s accounts from 1 April 2013.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong>Risk assessment</strong><br />The operations of the G &amp; L Beijer Group are affected by a number of external factors, the effects of which on the Group&rsquo;s operating profit can be controlled to a varying degree. The Group&rsquo;s operations are dependent on the general economic trend, especially in Europe, which controls the demand for G &amp; L Beijer&rsquo;s pro&shy;ducts and services. Acquisitions are normally linked with risks such as, for example, staff defection. Other operating risks, such as agency and supplier agreements, product responsibility and delivery undertaking, technical </span><br /><span style="font-size: 10pt"> development, warranties, dependence on indivi&shy;duals, etc., are continually being analysed and, when necessary, action is taken to reduce the Group&rsquo;s risk exposure. In its operations, G &amp; L Beijer is exposed to financial risks such as currency risk, interest risk and liquidity risk. The parent company&rsquo;s risk picture is the same as that of the Group. For further information, see G &amp; L Beijer&rsquo;s Annual Report.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: justify;font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong>Financial information</strong><br />-&nbsp;&nbsp; The Six-Month Report will be published on 17 July 2013.<br />-&nbsp;&nbsp; The Nine-Month Report will be published on 18 October 2013.<br />-&nbsp;&nbsp; The Year-End Report for 2013 will be published in February 2014.<br />-&nbsp;&nbsp; The Annual Report for 2013 will be published in April 2014.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><em></em>- Net sales increased by 15 per cent to SEK 6,758.3M (5,897.3).</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">- Operating profit amounted to SEK 419.9M (428.1).</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">- Excluding one-time items, the period&rsquo;s result amounted to SEK 293.1M (331.9). Including one-time items, the period&rsquo;s result was SEK 310.6M (370.0).</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">- Profit per share amounted to SEK 6.66 (7.69) excluding one-time items and the divested operation. Including one-time items and the divested operation, profit per share amounted to SEK 7.08 (8.49).</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><em>- </em>The Board of Directors proposes a dividend of SEK 4.75 per share (4.50).</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />G &amp; L Beijer is a technology-oriented trading Group which, through a combination of added-value agency products and products of the company&rsquo;s own development, offers competitive solutions within refrigeration and air conditioning.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong>Sales</strong><br />G &amp; L Beijer reported a stable trend and a significant increase in sales for the 2012 full year. The increase is mainly explained by the acquisitions of Toshiba&rsquo;s operation within air conditioning and heating as well as United Refrigeration&rsquo;s refrigeration wholesale operations in France and the United Kingdom during the fourth quarter of 2011. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Consolidated sales increased by 15 per cent to SEK 6,758.3M (5,897.3) for the 2012 full year. The acquisitions accounted for the sales increase during the period. Adjusted for currencies and excluding acquisitions, i.e. organic, sales fell by 2.7 per cent for the full year. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Sales amounted to SEK 1,543.3M (1,681.0) for the fourth quarter. The fall is explained by the generally lower demand which characterised the year and the stronger SEK. Organi&shy;cally, sales fell by 5.9 per cent. The acquired Toshiba operation, which is included from the fourth quarter of 2011 and has a stronger business cyclical and seasonal component than G &amp; L Beijer&rsquo;s other operations, affected sales negatively during the fourth quarter compared with the corresponding quarter previous year. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">The sales pattern from the first three quarters largely continued during the fourth quarter. Sales in southern Africa and Thailand continued to develop positively. The sales volumes in southern Europe, including France, Italy and Spain, were marginally lower. The volumes also declined in the Nordic countries and eastern Europe. In central Europe, including Belgium, Holland and Switzerland, the sales volumes increased slightly compared with the previous year. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">The acquisitions contributed sales of SEK 1,591.6M in total for the full year. The acquisitions of United Refrigeration&rsquo;s operations in France and the United Kingdom have been restructured which has resulted in lower expenses and increased profitability. Toshiba&rsquo;s operation within air conditioning and heating has developed in line with the expectations, taking into account a slowdown in demand. The Toshiba operation&rsquo;s sales for the 2012 full year fell compared with 2011. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">During the year, a number of structural changes and cost savings were carried out aimed at parrying the reduced demand in the market. In Switzerland, the operations were merged from three into two companies. In the United Kingdom, an office in London was closed and the operation moved to Leeds. In Italy, Belgium and Holland, staff reductions were made. In Ireland, the recently acquired company, Gasco, was merged with the existing operation within Dean &amp; Wood. The different measures are expected to generate annual cost savings of around SEK 40M. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">During 2012, G &amp; L Beijer initiated the establishment of a refrigeration wholesale operation in Germany with two offices, one in Ratingen and one in Leipzig.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong>Results</strong><br />Consolidated operating profit for the 2012 full year amounted to SEK 419.9M (428.1). The operating profit for the fourth quarter was SEK 88.7M (115.8). The result was positively affected by contributions from the acquired operations. However, the lower organic sales affected the results negatively. In addition, the result was charged with structural costs of SEK 5.8M for the closure of part of the operation in Switzerland during the fourth quarter and with setup expenses in Germany. The result was also affected negatively by a global price decrease of refrigerants during the year.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">The Group&rsquo;s financial income/expense amounted to SEK -11.0M (54.3) for the full year and to SEK -8,8M (-1.2) for the fourth quarter. Financial income/expense for the full year includes capital gains of SEK 22.0M from the divestment of a participation in the associated company, F&ouml;rvaltnings AB Norra Vallgatan, during the first quarter of 2012. The first quarter of 2011 includes the divestment of shares in Beijer Alma of SEK 51.7M. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Profit before tax amounted to SEK 408.9M (482.4) for the full year and to SEK 79.9M (114.6) for the fourth quarter. Profit after tax amounted to SEK 310.6M (370.0) for the full year and to SEK 54.3M (100.4) for the fourth quarter. Profit per share was SEK 7.08 (8.49). Excluding one-time items and the divested operation, profit per share was 6.66 (7.69). </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong>Dividend</strong><br />The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual Meeting of shareholders resolves that a dividend of SEK 4.75 (4.50) per share shall be paid for the 2012 financial year. This is equivalent to a total of SEK 201.4M if the shares currently held by the company are excluded. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong>Other financial information</strong><br />Consolidated capital expenditure including acquisitions amounted to SEK 83.1M (1,004.8) for the full year. Liquid funds, including unutilised bank overdraft facilities, were SEK 538.0M (677.2). Shareholders&rsquo; equity amounted to SEK 2,419.3M (2,418.9) at the year end. The net debt was SEK 1,208.6M (1,161.1). The equity ratio amounted to 48.3 per cent (47.5). The average number of employees during the period was 2,142 (1,867).</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong>Significant events</strong><br />In January 2012, G &amp; L Beijer acquired the Norwegian company, Ecofrigo AS. The company reports annual sales of approximately SEK 35M and has six employees. Ecofrigo is a project-oriented refrigeration distribution company which mainly operates within the planning and distribution of environment-friendly chillers and refrigerants. The acquisition complements G &amp; L Beijer&rsquo;s existing operation in Norway both geographically and product wise. Ecofrigo is included in G &amp; L Beijer&rsquo;s accounts from January 2012.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">G &amp; L Beijer AB is exercising its option and acquires the remaining 60 per cent of the shares in the jointly owned company, Metraclark LDA, in Mozambique. G &amp; L Beijer established an operation in Mozambique in November 2011 through its South African subsidiary, Metraclark, which together with the wholesaler, Logos Industrias, formed a joint-venture company. Initially, G &amp; L Beijer acquired 40 per cent of the newly formed company to which an operation was provided with annual sales of approximately SEK 15M.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">In connection with the transaction, G &amp; L Beijer received an option to acquire the remaining 60 per cent of the company, which is now exercised. The operation in Mozambique has developed positively and reported sales of around SEK 20M for 2012 with good profitability. Now that the company becomes wholly-owned, additional resources can be provided to enable the further development of the operation in the country.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">G &amp; L Beijer&rsquo;s operations in southern Africa, which includes South Africa, Botswana, Namibia and Mozambique, report strong growth. During 2012, sales increased by 13 per cent to more than SEK 620M, equivalent to nine per cent of consolidated sales.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /></span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<ul style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">
<li><span style="font-size: 10pt">Net sales increased by 24 per cent to SEK 5,215.0M (4,216.3).</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 10pt">Operating profit rose by six per cent to SEK 331.2M (312.3).</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 10pt">Excluding the capital gains, the period&rsquo;s result amounted to SEK 234.3M (231.5). Including the capital gains, the period&rsquo;s result was SEK 256.3M (269.6).</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 10pt">Profit per share amounted to SEK 5.34 (5.30) excluding the capital gains. Including the capital gains, profit per share amounted to SEK 5.86 (6.20).</span></li>
</ul>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">G &amp; L Beijer is a technology-oriented trading Group which, through a combination of added-value agency products and products of the company&rsquo;s own development, offers competitive solutions within refrigeration and air conditioning.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong>Sales</strong><br />G &amp; L Beijer continued its positive trend with an increase in sales and increased operating profit for the third <br /> quarter compared with the corresponding period in the previous year. The sales increase is explained by acquisitions.Sales for comparable units were lower due to a slowdown in demand in some markets and currency adjustments from the stronger SEK. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Consolidated sales increased by 24 per cent to SEK 5,215.0M (4,216.3) for the first nine months of the year. Sales for the third quarter rose by 18 per cent to SEK 1,733.9M (1,474.8). The acquisitions of Toshiba&rsquo;s operation within air conditioning and heating, as well as United Refrigeration&rsquo;s refrigeration wholesale operations in France and the United <br /> Kingdom, accounted for the increase in sales for the respective period. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">On translation of foreign currency into SEK, sales were negatively affected by the stronger SEK. Adjusted for currencies and excluding acquisitions, i.e. organic, sales fell by approxi&shy;mately two per cent for the nine-month period and by around two per cent for the third quarter. Sales in southern Africa and Thailand continued to develop positively. The sales volume in the Nordic countries and southern Europe, including France, Italy and Spain, were marginally lower. In Central Europe, including Belgium, Holland and Switzerland, the sales volumes fell compared with high levels in the previous year. Volumes also fell in Eastern Europe. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Together, the acquisitions contributed SEK 1,240M in sales for the first nine months and SEK 415M for the third quarter. The integration of United Refrigeration&rsquo;s operations in France and the United Kingdom continue according to the plan. The operations have been re&shy;structured, which has resulted in lower expenses. Toshiba&rsquo;s operation within air conditioning and heating, which was acquired 2011 and is included in the Group accounts from 1 October 2011, has also developed in line with the expectations taking into account a slowdown in demand. Sales for the Toshiba operation were lower for the nine-month period compared with 2011 which was a strong period, especially for the first half of the year. At the same time, the slowdown decreased during the third quarter. Toshiba&rsquo;s operation has a stronger business cyclical component through the air-conditioning than G &amp; L Beijer&rsquo;s other operation.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Through acquisitions and restructuring, G &amp; L Beijer has broadened its product portfolio and increased its geo&shy;graphic scope. G &amp; L Beijer is the leading operator in the sector in Europe which, especially during times of un&shy;certainty, is a competitive advantage. G &amp; L Beijer has also increased its readiness to meet a further slowdown in demand and keener competition. During the period, a programme was initiated aimed at increasing the pace in the continual streamlining and rationalisation.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong>Results</strong><br />Consolidated operating profit increased by six per cent to SEK 331.2M (312.3) for the first three quarters. For the third quarter, operating profit increased by six per cent to SEK 121.1M (114.5). The result improvements are essentially explained by contributions from the acquired operations. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">The Group&rsquo;s financial income/expense amounted to SEK -2.3M (55.5) for the nine-month period and to SEK -10.1M (5.2) for the third quarter. Financial income/expense for the nine-month period includes a capital gain of SEK 22.0M from the divestment of a participation in an associated company, F&ouml;rvaltnings AB Norra Vallgatan, during the first quarter of 2012. The first quarter of 2011 includes a capital gain of SEK 51.7M from the divestment of shares in Beijer Alma. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Profit before tax amounted to SEK 328.9M (367.8) for the first three quarters of the year, of which SEK 111.0M (119.7) for the third quarter. The corresponding period in 2011 included a share in profits of associated companies of SEK 8.2M. Profit after tax amounted to SEK 256.3M (269.6) for the nine-month period and to SEK 83.9M (92.1) for the third quarter. Profit per share amounted to SEK 5.86 (6.20). Excluding the capital gains, profit per share amounted to SEK 5.34 (5.30).</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong>Other financial information</strong><br />Consolidated financial expenditure, including acquisitions, amounted to SEK 69.1M (111.7) for the first three quarters. Liquid funds, including unutilised bank overdraft facilities, were SEK 469.5M (576.1). Shareholders&rsquo; equity amounted to SEK 2,368.8M (2,385.5) on 30 September 2012. Net debt was SEK 1,287.7M (325.6). The equity ratio amounted to 44.9 per cent (57.5). The average number of employees during the period was SEK 2,127 (1,834). Net debt, equity ratio and number of employees have been affected as a result of acquisitions. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong>Significant events</strong><br />In January 2012, G &amp; L Beijer acquired the Norwegian company, Ecofrigo AS. The company reports annual sales of approximately SEK 35M and has six employees. Ecofrigo is a project-oriented refrigeration distribution company which mainly operates within the planning and distribution of environment-friendly chillers and refrigerants. The acquisition complements G &amp; L Beijer&rsquo;s existing operation in Norway both geographically and product wise. Ecofrigo is included in G &amp; L Beijer&rsquo;s accounts from January 2012.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">In June, G &amp; L Beijer carried out a share split (2:1) which meant that each share was divided into two shares of the same class.

A review consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing, ISA, and other generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden. The procedures performed in a review do not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion. </span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">G &amp; L Beijer AB is acquiring 100 per cent of the Irish refrigeration company, Gasco Ireland Ltd. Gasco reports sales of approximately SEK 22M (EUR 2.6M) and has six employees.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">The acquisition is a step forward in the consolidation of the Irish market and G &amp; L Beijer becomes a leading refrigeration wholesaler in Ireland. Gasco is strong within refrigerants and complements G &amp; L Beijer&rsquo;s existing operation in Ireland, which has its main focus on refrigeration products and air conditioning.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Gasco Ireland will be merged with G &amp; L Beijer&rsquo;s Irish operation, Dean &amp; Wood. Pro forma sales will amount to approximately EUR 6M (around SEK 50M). The merger is expected to generate synergy gains through cost savings. The acquisition also involves an extended product programme with the opportunity to reach additional customer groups with an improved product and service offer.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">The consideration for 100 per cent of Gasco Ireland Ltd amounts to EUR 712,000 (approximately SEK 5.9M). The acquisition is deemed to have a marginal positive effect on G &amp; L Beijer&rsquo;s profit per share. Gasco Ireland Ltd will be included in G &amp; L Beijer&rsquo;s accounts from 1 August 2012.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<ul style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">
<li><span style="font-size: 10pt">Net sales increased by 27 per cent to SEK 3,481.1M (2,741.5).</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 10pt">Operating profit rose by six per cent to SEK 210.1M (197.8).</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 10pt">The period&rsquo;s result increased by eight per cent to SEK 150.4M (139.4) excluding the capital gains. Including the capital gains, the period&rsquo;s result amounted to SEK 172.4M (177.5).</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 10pt">Profit per share amounted to SEK 3.42 (3.20) excluding the capital gains. Including the capital gains, profit per share amounted to SEK 3.94 (4.10).</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 10pt">Share split 2:1 carried out in June.</span></li>
</ul>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">G &amp; L Beijer is a technology-oriented trading Group which, through a combination of added-value agency products and products of the company&rsquo;s own development, offers competitive solutions within refrigeration and air conditioning.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong>Sales</strong><br />G &amp; L Beijer continued its positive trend with an increase in sales and increasing operating profit for the second quarter compared with the corresponding period in the previous year. The sales increase is explained by acquisitions whilst sales for comparable units decreased due to a slowdown in demand in some markets and currency adjustments from the stronger SEK.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Consolidated sales increased by 27 per cent to SEK 3,481.1M (2,741.5) for the first half of the year. Sales for the second quarter rose by 24 per cent to SEK 1,826.3M (1,473.0). The large acquisitions of Toshiba&rsquo;s operation within air conditioning and heating, as well as United Refrigeration&rsquo;s refrigeration wholesale operation in France and the United Kingdom, accounted for the increase in sales for the respective period. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Adjusted for currencies and excluding acquisitions, i.e. organic, sales fell by approximately three per cent for the half-year period and by around seven per cent for the second quarter compared with the corresponding periods in 2011. The lower sales volume can mainly be attributed to Central Europe, including Belgium, Holland and Switzerland, which also enjoyed a very strong first half in 2011. Volumes also fell slightly in France, Italy and Spain. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Sales in Southern Africa and Thailand continued to develop positively. Sales in the Nordic countries, the United Kingdom and Eastern Europe were stable. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Together, the acquisitions contributed SEK 825M in sales for the first quarter and SEK 457M for the second quarter. The integration of United Refrigeration&rsquo;s operations in France and the United Kingdom continue according to the plan. The operations have been restructured, which has resulted in lower expenses. Toshiba&rsquo;s operation within air conditioning and heating has also developed in line with the expectations. Sales for the Toshiba operation were lower for the first half of 2012 compared with the same period in 2011 which was a strong six months. Compared with the first six months of 2010, sales were higher than for the corresponding period in 2012. Toshiba&rsquo;s operation has a stronger business cyclical component than G &amp; L Beijer&rsquo;s other operation.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong>Results</strong><br />Consolidated operating profit for the first half of the year increased by six per cent to SEK 210.1M (197.8) for the first half of the year. For the second quarter, operating profit increased by three per cent to SEK 129.0M (125.6). The result improvements are essentially explained by contributions from the acquired operations.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">The Group&rsquo;s financial income/expense amounted to SEK 7.8M (50.3) for the half-year period and to SEK -7.5M (0.3) for the second quarter. Financial income/expense for the six-month period includes capital gains of SEK 22.0M from the divestment of a participation in an associated company, F&ouml;rvaltnings AB Norra Vallgatan, during the first quarter of 2012. The first quarter of 2011 includes the divestment of shares in Beijer Alma of SEK 51.7M.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Profit before tax amounted to SEK 217.9M (248.1) for the first six months of the year and to SEK 121.5M (125.9) for the second quarter. Profit after tax decreased to SEK 172.4M (177.5) for the half-year period but increased to SEK 93.0M (89.7) for the second quarter. Profit per share amounted to SEK 3.94 (4.10) for the six-month period. Excluding the capital gains, profit per share amounted to SEK 3.42 (3.20).</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong>Other financial information</strong><br />Consolidated financial expenditure, including acquisitions, amounted to SEK 55.1M (97.8) for the first half of 2012. Liquid funds, including unutilised bank overdraft facilities, were SEK 492.0M (525.7). Shareholders&rsquo; equity amounted to SEK 2,402.7M (2,302.2) on 30 June 2012. Net debt was SEK 1,383.9M (372.9). The equity ratio amounted to 43.0 per cent (55.0). The average number of employees during the period was SEK 2,120 (1,817).</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong>Significant events</strong><br />In January 2012, G &amp; L Beijer acquired the Norwegian company, Ecofrigo AS. The company reports annual sales of approximately SEK 35M and has six employees. Ecofrigo is a project-oriented refrigeration distribution company which mainly operates within the planning and distribution of environment-friendly chillers and refrigerants. The acquisition complements G &amp; L Beijer&rsquo;s existing operation in Norway both geographically and product wise. Ecofrigo is included in G &amp; L Beijer&rsquo;s accounts from January 2012.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">In June, G &amp; L Beijer carried out a share split (2:1) which meant that each share was divided into two shares of the same class. After the split, G &amp; L Beijer&rsquo;s total number of shares amount to 42,478,230 distributed on 3,306,240 A shares and 39,171,990 B shares. The total number of votes amounts to 72,234,390 after the split. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong>Risk assessment</strong><br />The operations of the G &amp; L Beijer Group are affected by a number of external factors, the effects of which on the Group&rsquo;s operating profit can be controlled to a varying degree. The Group&rsquo;s operations are dependent on the general economic trend, especially in Europe, which controls the demand for G &amp; L Beijer&rsquo;s products and services. Acquisitions are normally linked with risks such as, for example, staff defection. Other operating risks, such as agency and supplier agreements, product responsibility and delivery undertaking, technical development, warranties, dependence on individuals, etc., are continually being analysed and, when necessary, action is taken to reduce the Group&rsquo;s risk exposure. In its operations, G &amp; L Beijer is exposed to financial risks such as currency risk, interest risk and liquidity risk. The parent company&rsquo;s risk picture is the same as that of the Group.</span></p>

The Board of Directors has now set a date for implementing the split as follows.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">The record date for the split will be 31 May 2012, which means that the last day for trades with non-split shares will be 28 May 2012. The first day for trades with split shares will be 29 May 2012.</span></p>

<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">The shares obtained through the split are expected to be registered on VP-accounts on 1 June 2012, which is the day after the record date. The split will be carried out automatically by Euroclear and shareholders do not need take any action. After the split, the number of shares in G &amp; L Beijer AB will amount to 42,478,230, of which 3,306,240 will be series A shares and 39,171,990 series B shares.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><strong></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Today, 26 April 2012, G &amp; L Beijer AB (publ) held its Annual Meeting of shareholders for the 2011 financial year. The Annual Meeting adopted the profit and loss accounts and balance sheets for 2011 and the Board Members and the Managing Director were discharged from liability.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">The Annual Meeting endorsed the Board of Directors&rsquo; proposal for a dividend of SEK 9.00 per share for the 2011 financial year and 2 May 2012 as the record day. The dividend is expected to be remitted by Euroclear Sweden AB on 7 May 2012.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">In his speech at the Annual Meeting, the Managing Director of G &amp; L Beijer, Joen Magnusson, gave an account of the company&rsquo;s operation during 2011 and for the first quarter of 2012. In addition, the Annual Meeting of shareholders passed the following resolutions: </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">That the lawyer Johan Sigeman is appointed Chairman of the Annual Meeting. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">That the Board of Directors shall consist of seven Board Members and no Deputy Board Members.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">That the Directors&rsquo; fees shall be SEK 1,165,000. The Chairman will receive SEK 415,000 and the Board </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Members who are not employed in the company or within the Carrier Group will receive SEK 250,000 each. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">That the remuneration of the Auditors will be paid in accordance with the submitted quotation. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">That Peter Jessen J&uuml;rgensen, Anne-Marie P&aring;lsson, Bernt Ingman, Joen Magnusson, Philippe Delpech, Harald Link and William Stribe are re-elected as Board Members. The Annual Meeting also elected Peter Jessen J&uuml;rgensen as Chairman of the Board. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">That the registered public accounting firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers, Malm&ouml;, is elected as auditor in the company, with the Authorised Public Accountant, Lars Nilsson, as auditor in charge. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">That the company shall have an Election Committee consisting of one representative of each of the four largest shareholders together with the Chairman of the Board. When the composition of the Election </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Committee is decided, the conditions on the last banking date in August 2012 shall determine who are the largest owners by number of votes. If any of the four largest shareholders refrains from appointing a Member, the right shall be passed on to the owner who is next in size. The names of the Members, including the Chairman and the shareholders who have appointed them, shall be announced as soon as possible and not later than six months prior to the 2013 Annual Meeting of shareholders when the following shall apply:</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">&bull; The Members of the Election Committee shall appoint the Chairman of the Election Committee who must not be a Board Member. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">&bull; No special remuneration shall be paid for the work in the Election Committee.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">&bull; A shareholder who has appointed a Member of the Election Committee may remove the Member and appoint a new Member and, when required, replace a Member who has left the Election Committee before the work has been completed. If a Member no longer represents one of the four largest owners, such a Member can resign, if the Election Committee finds it appropriate, and a replacement can be appointed by the owner who has by then become the fourth largest owner.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">&bull; Changes in the composition of the Election Committee, if any, shall be announced as soon as they have been made. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">&bull; The Election Committee shall work out proposals to be placed before the 2013 Annual Meeting of share&shy;holders for resolutions on the following matters: (a) Chairman of the Annual Meeting of shareholders, (b) Board of Directors, (c) Chairman of the Board, (d) Directors&rsquo; fees, (e) remuneration of the company&rsquo;s auditors (f) Auditors and (g) rules for the appointment of the Election Committee ahead of the 2014 Annual Meeting of shareholders.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">That the guidelines for the remuneration and other terms of employment for senior executives are adopted as follows: By senior executive is meant the Managing Director, the Chief Financial Officer and the Managing Director of Beijer Ref AB as well as the Head of the Toshiba HVAC operation. The remuneration shall consist of a fixed salary, a variable salary, a pension and other remuneration such as a company car. The total remuneration shall be on market terms and should support the interest of the shareholders by enabling the company to attract and retain senior executives. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">The fixed salary is renegotiated annually and takes into account the area of responsibility, competence, performance and experience of the individual. The variable part of the salary is based on the outcome in relation to set financial targets. The individual will receive a maximum amount equivalent to six months&rsquo; salary. On the maximum outcome, the cost for the variable portion of the salary is estimated to amount to SEK 4.3M in total. The Executive Management&rsquo;s pension scheme is contribution-based. An amount equivalent to 26 per cent of the gross salary, including variable salary, is appropriated annually for the Managing Director, and to an amount of up to 24 per cent of the gross salary, including variable salary, for the other Members of the Executive Management.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Severance pay of not more than 24 months' salary, including salary at notice, will be paid to the Managing Director. Severance pay to the other Members of the Executive Management varies and amounts to not more than 24 months' salary including salary at notice. The Executive Management can give six months' notice of termination. Notice of termination by the Managing Director or other senior executives does not trigger any severance pay. The Board of Directors prepares matters of remuneration and other terms of employment for the Executive Management and the Board of Directors as a whole constitutes the Remuneration Committee. The Managing Director does not participate in the work. The Board of Directors may abandon these guidelines if there are specific reasons for it in an individual case.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">That a share split is carried out so that each existing share is split into two shares of the same class. The decision means that the number of shares is doubled and that the nominal value of the share is halved. After the share split has been carried out, the company will have 42,478,230 shares represented by 3,306,240 A shares and 39,171,990 B shares. The objective of the share split is to increase the liquidity in the share. The Board of Directors will decide that 31 May 2012 will be the date of execution for the share split at Euroclear Sweden AB.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">That the Articles of Association are amended on account of the proposed share split proposed by the Board of Directors. The resolution means that the limits for number of shares in Para 5 are amended so that the lowest number of shares shall be 20,000,000 and the highest number of shares shall be 80,000,000.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">The resolutions regarding a share split and an amendment to the limits for the number of shares also include authorisation for the company&rsquo;s Managing Director to make any minor adjustments in the Annual Meeting&rsquo;s resolutions which may be necessary in connection with registration at the Companies Registration Office or Euroclear.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><strong></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">- Net sales increased by 30 per cent to SEK 1,654.8M (1,268.5).</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">- Operating profit rose by 12 per cent to SEK 81.1M (72.3).</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">- Net profit for the period excluding capital gain increased by 15 per cent to SEK 57.4M (49.7). Including the capital gain, net profit for the period amounted to SEK 79.3M (87.8).</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">- Profit per share excluding the capital gain increased to SEK 2.60 (2.25). Including the capital gain, profit per share amounted to SEK 3.64 (4.05).</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">- Acquisition of the Norwegian company, Ecofrigo.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">- Divestment of a participation in an associated company and strengthened financial position.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">G &amp; L Beijer is a technology-oriented trading Group which, through a combination of added-value agency products and products of the company&rsquo;s own development, offers competitive solutions within refrigeration and air conditioning.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong>Sales</strong><br />G &amp; L Beijer reported continued growth with increased sales and increased operating profit for the first quarter compared with the same period in the previous year. The out&shy;come is positive taking into account the global economic uncer&shy;tainty and the fact that the first quarter of 2011 was stronger than normal. The seasonal variation in sales and results has also been increased with the acquisition of Toshiba&rsquo;s operation within air conditioning and heating. During a normal year, the second and third quarters are stronger than the first and fourth quarters.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Consolidated sales increased by 30 per cent to SEK 1,654.8M (1,268.5) for the first quarter. Organic growth amounted to three per cent. The large acquisitions of Toshiba&rsquo;s operation within air conditioning and heating, and United Refrigeration&rsquo;s refrigeration wholesale operations in France and the United Kingdom, accounted for the majority of the sales increase. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">The organic growth is mainly explained by a positive trend in the Nordic countries. The operations in southern <br /> Africa and Thailand also reported good growth. Sales in the United Kingdom increased slightly whilst the picture in southern Europe was more fragmented. For example, sales in France were stable, whilst sales in Italy and Spain were weaker. In Central Europe, including Belgium, Holland and Switzerland sales fell compared with a very strong period in 2011. Eastern Europe reported subdued sales. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">All in all, the acquisitions contributed sales of SEK 348M for the first quarter. The integration of United Refrigeration&rsquo;s operations in France and the United Kingdom are proceeding in accordance with the plan. These operations have been restructured, which has resulted in lower overhead costs. This also applies for the Toshiba business within air conditioning and heating, which has developed in line with forecasts. Sales for the Toshiba operation were lower compared with the same period in 2011 which was a strong quarter. Compared with the first quarter of 2010, sales were higher than for the corresponding quarter in 2012. Toshiba&rsquo;s operation has both a stronger seasonal pattern and a more business cyclical component than G &amp; L Beijer&rsquo;s other operation.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong>Results</strong><br />Consolidated operating profit rose by 12 per cent to SEK 81.1M (72.3) for the first quarter. The result improvement is essentially explained by contributions from the acquired operations.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">The Group&rsquo;s financial income/expense amounted to SEK 15.3M (50.0). Financial income/expense includes capital gain of SEK 22.0M from the divestment of a participation in the associated company, F&ouml;rvaltnings AB Norra Vall&shy;gatan, during the first quarter of 2012 and the divestment of shares in Beijer Alma amounting to SEK 51.7M for the first quarter of 2011. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Profit before taxes amounted to SEK 96.4M (122.3). Profit after tax amounted to SEK 79.3M (87.8) and adjusted for one-time items it increased to SEK 57.4M (49.7). Profit per share was SEK 3.64 (4.05). Excluding the capital gain, profit per share increased by 16 per cent to SEK 2.60(2.25).</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong>Other financial information</strong><br />Consolidated capital expenditure, including acquisitions, amounted to SEK 39.7M (88.4) for the first quarter of 2012. Liquid funds, including unutilised bank overdraft facilities, were SEK 751.1M (717.0). The settlement from the divestment of a participation in an associated company has been paid in April 2012 which will strengthen liquidity and the Group&rsquo;s financial position. Shareholders&rsquo; equity amounted to SEK 2,479.4M (2,322.2). Net debt was SEK 1,071.6M (143.6) at the turn of the quarter and SEK 1,142,1M at the latest year end. The equity ratio amounted to 47.1 per cent (59.8). The average number of employees during the period was 2,093 (1,823).</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong>Significant events</strong><br />In January 2012, G &amp; L Beijer acquired the Norwegian company, Ecofrigo. The company reports annual sales of <br /> approximately SEK 35M and has six employees. Ecofrigo is a project-oriented refrigeration distribution company which mainly operates within the planning and distribution of environment-friendly chillers and refrigerants. The acquisition complements G &amp; L Beijer&rsquo;s existing operation in Norway both geographically and product wise. Ecofrigo is included in G &amp; L Beijer&rsquo;s accounts from January 2012.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong>Risk assessment</strong><br />The operations of the G &amp; L Beijer Group are affected by a number of external factors, the effects of which on the Group&rsquo;s operating profit can be controlled to a varying degree. The Group&rsquo;s operations are dependent on the general economic trend, especially in Europe, which controls the demand for G &amp; L Beijer&rsquo;s products and services. Acquisitions are normally linked with risks such as, for example, staff defection. Other operating risks, such as agency and supplier agreements, product responsibility and delivery undertaking, technical development, warranties, depen&shy;dence on individuals, etc., are continually being analysed and, when necessary, action is taken to reduce the Group&rsquo;s risk exposure. In its operations, G &amp; L Beijer is exposed to financial risks such as currency risk, interest risk and liquidity risk. The parent company&rsquo;s risk picture is the same as that of the Group. For further information, please see the G &amp; L Beijer Annual Report for 2011, page 38.</span></p>

<p></p><p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Beijer Ref is getting a partly changed ownership structure. One of the principal shareholders, Peter Jessen J&uuml;rgensen, has divested all of his 1,618,400 B shares and 334,632 A shares, in total equivalent to 6.9 per cent of the votes and 4.6 per cent of the capital.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"></p><p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">The Election Committee in Beijer Ref AB has decided to submit the following proposal to the Annual General Meeting of shareholders relating to the number of Board Members and the election of Board Members.</p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">The Election Committee proposes that the number of Members of the Board of Directors shall be seven.</p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">The Election Committee proposes the re-election as Board Members of Bernt Ingman, Joen Magnusson, Peter Jessen J&uuml;rgensen, Philippe Delpech and Bill Striebe. In addition, it proposes the election as Board Members of Frida Norrbom Sams and Monica Gimre. Ann-Marie P&aring;lsson and Harald Link are not standing for re-election. In addition, Bernt Ingman is proposed for re-election as Chairman of the Board of Directors.</p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Based on the company&rsquo;s operation, its phase of development and market conditions in general, the Election Committee has discussed the Board of Directors&rsquo; diversity, size and composition relating to sector experience, competence, distribution according to sex, and international experience. The Election Committee has searched for individuals with international industrial experience with the aim of contributing to the company&rsquo;s continued international expansion. Because of their professional experience and competence the Election Committee is of the opinion that both Frida Norrbom Sams and Monica Gimre are eminently suitable as candidates for election to the Board of Directors of Beijer Ref.</p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><strong>Frida Norrbom Sams</strong> <em>(born 1971, M.Sc. Business Administration)</em> has a long experience of leading positions with a focus on, among other things, business development, establishing a presence in new markets, change management and capital rationalisation. In recent years, she has been active within the Husqvarna group, most recently in the group management as Executive Vice President, Head of the EMEA business unit. Frida Norrbom Sams has previously worked within Sanitec Corporation and Bearingpoint.

<p><span style="font-size: 18pt"><strong>Acquisition of RNA in Malaysia strengthens the expansion outside Europe </strong></span></p><p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">The Swedish refrigeration wholesale group, Beijer Ref AB, is acquiring all the shares in the refrigeration wholesale company, RNA Engineering &amp; Trading, which has its head office located in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.</p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">RNA Engineering &amp; Trading was established in 1975. The company reports sales of approximately SEK 45M. RNA is the leading refrigeration wholesaler in Malaysia and includes Danfoss, Emerson and Thermal-Matic among its important brands. The Malaysian market for commercial refrigeration is estimated to be worth nearly SEK 480M, with stable growth in past years of around 10 per cent per annum.</p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><em>&rdquo;The acquisition complements our existing operation in the region and strengthens our presence outside Europe. This is fully in line with our strategy&rdquo;,</em> says Per Bertland, CEO of Beijer Ref.</p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">RNA Engineering &amp; Trading is being acquired by Beijer Ref&rsquo;s joint-venture company B Grimm in Thailand. The company will be integrated into Beijer Ref&rsquo;s organisation and included in the company&rsquo;s accounts from March 2015. The acquisition is expected to have a marginally positive effect of Beijer Ref&rsquo;s net income in 2015.</p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">RNA Engineering &amp; Trading&rsquo;s management will continue to take an active part in the company.</p>

<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt">Quarter 4 2014</span></strong></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Net sales amounted to SEK 1,789.7M (1,589.2).</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Operating profit amounted to SEK 115.5M (98.9). </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Net profit amounted to SEK 82.5M (61.1). </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Profit per share amounted to SEK 1.91 (1.38).</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Sales growth of 12.6 per cent and operating profit improvement of 16.7 per cent compared with the corresponding quarter in the previous year. Organic growth in sales of 4.8 per cent and organic increase in operating profit of 13.0 per cent.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">New acquisition, GFOI on the R&eacute;union Island in the southern hemisphere. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">The Board of Directors proposes a dividend of SEK 5.00 (4.75) per share.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt">Comments by the CEO </span></strong></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt">Strong growth in several markets</span></strong></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt">With increased sales of 13 per cent, of which an organic growth of five per cent and an operating profit of SEK 115.5M, the fourth quarter showed the strongest rate of increase during 2014, both organically and totally &ndash; a convincing end to the year characterised by a number of strategically important decisions and events such as the EU&rsquo;s resolution about a new f-gas ordinance. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In some of the Group&rsquo;s geographic segments, the increase was considerable. In the Nordic countries, sales increased by 23 per cent, in Central Europe by 10 per cent and in A&amp;A (Africa and Asia), Thailand achieved six per cent and South Africa 18 per cent. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Nordic countries lead the development with regard to the changeover from f-gases to environment-friendly refrigerants. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt">This favours Beijer Ref which has a strong position in the sector. The United Kingdom continues to convince with its extensive </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt">domestic service concept. In the largest market in Europe, Germany, the operation established from scratch by Beijer Ref a few years ago has gained a solid foothold. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, the individually largest market region, Southern Europe, has continuing difficulties in achieving the levels that </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt">prevailed prior to the conflict between Russia and Ukraine and the European financial crisis. The five countries, South Africa, Namibia, Botswana, Mozambique and Zambia showed that Africa with its considerable requirement for modern refrigeration systems remains a highly interesting market for Beijer Ref with 10 per cent organic growth in the fourth quarter. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt">New acquisition in the southern hemisphere </span></strong></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt">In October, Beijer Ref acquired all the shares in the French refrigeration wholesaler GFOI (G&eacute;n&eacute;rale Frigorifique Oc&eacute;an Indien), </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt">which is based on the R&eacute;union Island and located approximately 800 kilometres east of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean. GFOI reports sales of approximately SEK 50M and is the leading refrigeration wholesaler on R&eacute;union, which is a French d&eacute;partement with more than 840,000 inhabitants and a rapidly expanding tourist industry. GFOI will be integrated into Beijer Ref and will serve as a branch of the Group&rsquo;s French refrigeration wholesaler, GFF. With the acquisition, Beijer Ref reaches sales of more than SEK 700M in the southern hemisphere.<strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt">Own manufacturing restructured</span></strong></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt">Since the acquisition of the remaining 49 per cent of the shares in SCM Frigo in July 2014, the Group&rsquo;s newly-established Beijer Ref OEM business area, under the management of the Italian company, has increased its venture into own production of both standardised and customer-adapted environment-friendly refrigeration systems as well as the training of customers and suppliers in environment-friendly refrigeration technology under the name, Beijer Ref Academy. The first company in addition to SCM Frigo to adapt the new </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt">manufacturing concept was DEM in Vislanda, under the name SCMREF AB. During 2015, Beijer Ref&rsquo;s own operation will be made more efficient under the management of its Italian production company.<strong> </strong></span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt">Carrier DX ready for launch during the first quarter of 2015</span></strong></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt">During the fourth quarter, the work of relaunching Carrier&rsquo;s technically updated DX products (comfort cooling) has been completed. We are now ready to start up sales and distribution of Carrier&rsquo;s heat-pump and air-conditioning programme in most European countries on an exclusive basis. <strong></strong></span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><strong><span style="font-size: 9.5pt">2015</span></strong></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt">The weaker SEK has favoured us as more than 95 per cent of invoicing is made in foreign currency. Current exchange rates will most probably signify further positive exchange effects, at least during the first quarter of the year. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The EU&rsquo;s resolution about a new f-gas ordinance involves the phasing out of old refrigerants which means that a comprehensive adaptation of the refrigeration sector is likely. New environment-friendly refrigerants &ndash; either natural, such as carbon dioxide, or </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt">synthetic, will replace the current HFC-based technology. Beijer Ref stands well equipped for this change-over with its long experience within carbon dioxide-based solutions. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 9.5pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In line with the company&rsquo;s dividend policy, the Beijer Ref Board of Directors proposes an increased dividend of SEK 5.00 (4.75).<strong> </strong></span><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt"></span></strong></p>

<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Beijer Ref is one of the largest refrigeration wholesalers in the world and the leading company in Europe. The Group offers competitive and innovative solutions within refrigeration and air conditioning providing customer-adapted products, environment-friendly and energy-efficient chillers developed by the company itself and an efficient service.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt">Sales</span></strong><span style="font-size: 11pt"></span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Beijer Ref increased its sales by 12.6 per cent to SEK 1,789.7M (1,589.2) for the fourth quarter of 2014. Adjusted for exchange rate fluctuations and acquisitions, the organic change in sales was 4.8 per cent. Accumulated for twelve months, the organic growth amounts to 3.1 per cent. For the 2014 full year, the Group&rsquo;s turnover amounted to SEK 7,189.0M (6,595.4).</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Beijer Ref operates in three market areas: commercial refrigeration, industrial refrigeration and HVAC (comfort cooling). The Group splits its operation in the global market into five geographic segments: The Nordic countries, Central Europe, Eastern Europe, Southern Europe and A&amp;A (Africa and Asia). </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Behind the quarter&rsquo;s sales increase lies a positive development in Central Europe, the Nordic countries and A&amp;A whereas the southern and east European markets report a weak demand. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt">Results</span></strong><span style="font-size: 11pt"></span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">The Group&rsquo;s operating profit amounted to SEK 115.5M (98.9) for the fourth quarter. The result increase can mainly be explained by increased sales, especially in the Nordic countries, Central Europe and A&amp;A. When adjusted for exchange rate fluctuations and acquisitions, the organic increase in operating profit was 13 per cent. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">In the previous year&rsquo;s figures, the accumulated operating result is charged with one-time costs of SEK 34.2M. For the 2014 full year, the operating profit amounted to SEK 481.4M (377.7). Excluding one-time costs, the operating profit was SEK 411.9M in the previous year. The organic increase for the 2014 full year was 23.0 per cent.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">The Group&rsquo;s financial income/expense amounted to SEK -8.3M (-7.4) for the fourth quarter. Profit before tax was SEK 107.2M (91.5). Profit after tax was SEK 82.5M (61.1). Profit per share amounted to SEK 1.91 (1.38). For the 2014 full year, the Group&rsquo;s financial income/expense amounted to SEK -34.9M (-31.1). Profit before tax was SEK 446.5M (346.6). Profit after tax amounted to SEK 324.5M (244.2). Profit per share was SEK 7.46 (5.51).</span></p>

<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual Meeting of shareholders resolves that a dividend of SEK 5.00 (4.75) per share shall be paid for the 2014 financial year. This is equivalent to a total of SEK 212.0M if the shares currently held by the company are excluded.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt">Other financial information</span></strong><span style="font-size: 11pt"></span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Consolidated capital expenditure, including acquisitions, amounted to SEK 182.6M (57.6) for the 2014 full year. Of this, the major portion refers to the acquisition of the remaining 49 per cent in SCM Frigo. Liquid funds, including unutilised bank overdraft facilities, were SEK 503.8M (563.2) on 31 December 2014. Shareholders&rsquo; equity amounted to SEK 2,618.6M (2,417.0). The net debt was SEK 1,429.8M (1,211.5). The equity ratio amounted to 46.0 per cent (47.3). The average number of employees during the period was 2,207 (2,137).</span></p>

<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">In January, Beijer Ref acquired all the shares in Eurocool (Pty) Ltd, a leading refrigeration wholesaler in South Africa. Eurocool was founded in 1999 and currently holds a strong market position within Beijer Ref&rsquo;s priority segments. The company reports sales of approximately SEK 65M and has 36 employees. The acquisition is estimated to provide cost synergies, increased efficiency and increased purchasing volumes through the co-ordination with Beijer Ref&rsquo;s existing operation in southern Africa. The acquisition is deemed to have a marginal positive effect on Beijer Ref&rsquo;s profit per share in 2014. Eurocool is included in Beijer Ref&rsquo;s accounts from January 2014.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">On 12 March, the EU Parliament voted &lsquo;yes&rsquo; to the proposal about a new f-gas ordinance which was confirmed by the Council of Ministers in a vote on 14 April. As a result, the decision to phase out refrigerants with fluorised greenhouse gases (f-gases) has come into force which is predicted to have a positive effect on Beijer Ref through the investments in new technology which the end customers will gradually need to make and where Beijer Ref is well prepared for the new rules and regulations.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">On 14 May, the Swedish Companies Registration Office approved the Group&rsquo;s change of name from G &amp; L Beijer to Beijer Ref. A classic Swedish industrial company&rsquo;s modern operation is now also reflected in the company name.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">In July, Beijer Ref acquired the remaining 49 per cent of the shares in the Italian SCM Frigo Group, a leading manufacturer in Europe of, among other things, chillers based on environment-friendly technology. The company reports sales of around SEK 240M and has 90 employees. The acquisition is deemed to have a positive effect on Beijer Ref&rsquo;s net income already in 2014. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">In August, Beijer Ref acquired all the shares in a leading refrigeration wholesaler in Norway, B&oslash;rresen Cooltech AS. B&oslash;rresen Cooltech reports sales of SEK 60M, has 20 employees and will be integrated into Beijer Ref&rsquo;s organisation. The acquisition is deemed to have a marginally positive effect on Beijer Ref&rsquo;s net income. B&oslash;rresen Cooltech is included in the consolidated accounts from August 2014.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">In September, Beijer Ref strengthened its position in the rapidly growing German refrigeration wholesale market when it acquired the net assets in Gr&uuml;n Gro&szlig;handel f&uuml;r K&auml;lte- und Klima&shy;zubeh&ouml;r. The company reports sales of approximately SEK 25M, has seven employees and gives the Group a strategically important presence in Stuttgart. The acquisition is deemed to have a marginally positive effect on Beijer Ref&rsquo;s net income. The company is included in the consolidated accounts from October 2014. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">In October, Beijer Ref acquired all the shares in the French refrigeration wholesaler, GFOI (G&eacute;n&eacute;rale Frigorifique Oc&eacute;an Indien). GFOI is located on the R&eacute;union Island approximately 800 kilometres east of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean. The company reports sales of around SEK 50M, has seven employees and is a step in the Group&rsquo;s expansion outside Europe. The acquisition is deemed to have a marginally positive effect on Beijer Ref&rsquo;s net income. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt">Events after the end of the reporting period</span></strong><span style="font-size: 11pt"></span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">In January 2015, Beijer Ref signed a new exclusive distribution agreement with Carrier the world-leading American refrigeration group. The agreement gives Beijer Ref the exclusive right to sales and service of the DX comfort cooling products in Europe. Beijer Ref already has the sole right for the distribution of Toshiba&rsquo;s air-conditioning units, heat pumps and ventilation systems, and the agreement with Carrier further strengthens the Group&rsquo;s product supply.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt">Risk assessment</span></strong><span style="font-size: 11pt"> </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">The operations of the Beijer Ref Group are affected by a number of external factors, the effects of which on the Group&rsquo;s operating profit can be controlled to a varying degree. The Group&rsquo;s operation is dependent on the general economic trend, especially in Europe, which controls the demand for Beijer Ref&rsquo;s products and services. Acquisitions are normally linked with risks such as, for example, staff defection. Other operating risks, such as agency and supplier agreements, product responsibility and delivery undertaking, technical development, warranties, dependence on individuals, etc., are continually being analysed and, when necessary, action is taken to reduce the Group&rsquo;s risk exposure. In its operation, Beijer Ref is exposed to financial risks such as currency risk, interest risk and liquidity risk. The parent company&rsquo;s risk picture is the same as that of the Group. For further information see the Group&rsquo;s Annual Report.</span></p>

<ul style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">
<li><span style="font-size: 10pt">Net sales amounted to SEK 1,947.4M (1,830.4).<br /><br /></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 10pt">Operating profit amounted to SEK 157.8M (146.7). <br /><br /></span></li>

Organic decrease of turnover by 1.1 per cent and organic increase of operating profit by 1.4 per cent.<br /><br /></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 10pt">Three new acquisitions and the creation of the new Beijer Ref OEM business area for own manufacturing.</span></li>
</ul>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />Comments by the CEO </strong></span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong>Slower growth in troubled Europe</strong><br />The third quarter of 2014 shows that Beijer Ref continues to deliver growth with an increase in sales of 6.4 per cent and an operating profit of SEK 157.8M in spite of an unusually cold summer in southern Europe and the slowdown in demand due to the Ukraine crisis.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">In Central Europe, the Group&rsquo;s companies in the United Kingdom continue to report good results with strong sales as well as increased market share. In three years, Beijer Ref has progressed from third place to a position as leader in the British market. Beijer Ref&rsquo;s business concept, where rapid service and security of delivery are decisive for end customers such as leading supermarkets, together with acquisitions, important reasons for the increased market share. Holland and Germany developed well during the third quarter and continue to report growth and increased market share. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">In Eastern Europe, Poland continues to pull the region in a positive direction whilst sales in Southern Europe were affected by a squeezed macro-economy as well as bad summer weather throughout the region. The cold and rainy summer in France, Spain and Italy affected both demand within comfort cooling, HVAC (heating, ventilation and air conditioning), and commercial refrigeration.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">After the expectant start of the first six months for Beijer Ref&rsquo;s Nordic market region, the trend changed during the third quarter with increased sales of 21 per cent. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">In Africa and Asia (A&amp;A), Thailand fell slightly, whereas southern Africa reported strong growth. In this region, all integration costs relating to the acquisition of Eurocool have been absorbed and, with a sales increase of 13 per cent, the operation in southern Africa currently exceeds the plans. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong>Significant acquisitions</strong><br />During the third quarter, Beijer Ref strengthened its position as one of the three largest refrigeration wholesalers with three important acquisitions. Among other things, the Group chose to bring forward the option to acquire the remaining 49 per cent of the shares in the Italian SCM Frigo Group, a leading manufacturer in Europe of refrigeration units based on environment-friendly technology. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">In addition Beijer Ref in August acquired all the shares in B&oslash;rresen Cooltech AS, a leading refrigeration wholesaler in Norway. B&oslash;rresen Cooltech reports sales of just under SEK 60M, has 20 employees and will be integrated into of Beijer Ref&rsquo;s Norwegian organisation. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">In September, Beijer Ref strengthened its growing position in the German refrigeration wholesale market when it acquired the net assets in Gr&uuml;n Gro&szlig;handel f&uuml;r K&auml;lte- und Klimazubeh&ouml;r in Stuttgart. With this, Beijer Ref has acquired operations in D&uuml;sseldorf, Nuremberg, Munich and Leipzig since it established an operation in Germany in 2011 and now also an excellent geographic location in Stuttgart.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">In addition to the aforementioned, the Group has made yet another acquisition after the end of the reporting period when it acquired all the shares in the French refrigeration wholesaler, GFOI (G&eacute;n&eacute;rale Frigorifique Oc&eacute;an Indien) in October. GFOI is located on the R&eacute;union Island approximately 800 kilometres east of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean, a French d&eacute;partement with a rapidly expanding tourist industry. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong>Own manufacturing becomes a new business area</strong><br />With SCM Frigo as the base, the Group has created the new business area, Beijer Ref OEM, during the third quarter with the aim of carrying out own manufacturing of customer-adapted refrigeration systems. Since it was established in 1979, SCM Frigo has built up a unique technical competence and is currently one of the leading manufacturers in the world of environment-friendly refrigeration systems. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Several companies within the Beijer Ref Group already carry out own manufacturing of customer-adapted refrigeration systems. However, with the creation of Beijer Ref OEM this operation will be carried out in an even more structured and efficient form under the leadership of the leading manufacturer in Europe, which is expected to provide a number of positive synergy effects. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong>Logistics the next focus area</strong><br />In an increasingly borderless and homogenous Europe, logistics is increasingly becoming a decisive factor for competitiveness. With more than 200 branches in Europe, Beijer Ref will, in the future, place a strong focus on making the flow of products still more efficient with increased service and reduced costs as the objective. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><em>Per Bertland<br />CEO, Beijer Ref AB</em></span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong>About Beijer Ref</strong><br />Beijer Ref is one of the three largest refrigeration wholesalers in the world and the leading company in Europe. The Group offers competitive and innovative solutions within refrigeration and air conditioning providing customer-adapted products, refrigeration units developed by the company itself and an efficient service.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong>Sales</strong><br />Beijer Ref increased its sales by 6.4 per cent to SEK 1,947.4M (1,830.4) for the third quarter of 2014. Adjusted for exchange rate fluctuations and acquisitions, the organic change in sales was minus one per cent. Accumulated for nine months, the organic growth amounts to three per cent. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Beijer Ref operates in three market areas: commercial refrigeration, industrial refrigeration and HVAC (comfort cooling). The Group splits its operation in the global market into five geographic segments: The Nordic countries, Central Europe, Eastern Europe, Southern Europe and A&amp;A. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Behind the quarter&rsquo;s sales increase lie acquisitions and a weaker Swedish krona as well as a good development in Central Europe, Nordic countries and A&amp;A. However, sales for the quarter were affected by the slightly weaker south European markets and a cold summer in Europe. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong>Results</strong><br />The Group&rsquo;s operating profit amounted to SEK 157.8M (146.7) for the third quarter. The result increase can mainly be explained by increased sales, especially in Central Europe and Eastern Europe where Poland continues to be a driving market. Adjusted for exchange rate fluctuations and acquisitions, the organic change in operating profit was 1.4 per cent.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">In the previous year&rsquo;s figures, the accumulated operating result is charged with one-time costs of SEK 34.2M. For the first nine months, the operating profit amounted to SEK 366.0M (278.8). Excluding one-time costs, the operating profit was SEK 313.0M in the previous year. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">The Group&rsquo;s financial income/expense amounted to SEK -10.6M (-9.0) for the third quarter. Profit before tax was SEK 147.2M (137.9). Profit after tax was SEK 107.0M (100.2). Profit per share amounted to SEK 2.49 (2.30). For the nine months of the year, the Group&rsquo;s financial income/expense amounted to SEK -26.7M (-24.0). Profit before tax was SEK 339.3M (255.0). Profit after tax amounted to SEK 242.0M (183.0). Profit per share was SEK 5.56 (4.13).</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong>Other financial information</strong><br />Consolidated capital expenditure, including acquisitions, amounted to SEK 136.5M (41.2) for the first nine months of 2014. Of this, the major portion refers to the acquisition of the remaining 49 per cent in SCM Frigo. Liquid funds, including unutilised bank overdraft facilities, were SEK 598.9M (513.1) on 30 September 2014. Shareholders&rsquo; equity amounted to SEK 2,457.5M (2,305.1). The net debt was SEK 1,528.9M (1,302.2). The equity ratio amounted to 41.6 per cent (44.0). The average number of employees during the period was 2,194 (2,119).</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong>Significant events during the year</strong><br />In January, Beijer Ref acquired all the shares in Eurocool (Pty) Ltd, a leading refrigeration wholesaler in South Africa. Eurocool was founded in 1999 and currently holds a strong market position within Beijer Ref&rsquo;s priority segments. The company reports sales of approximately SEK 65M and has 36 employees. The acquisition is estimated to provide cost synergies, increased efficiency and increased purchasing volumes through the co-ordination with Beijer Ref&rsquo;s existing operation in southern Africa. The acquisition is deemed to have a marginal positive effect on Beijer Ref&rsquo;s profit per share in 2014. Eurocool is included in Beijer Ref&rsquo;s accounts from January 2014.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">On 12 March, the EU Parliament voted &lsquo;yes&rsquo; to the proposal about a new F-gas ordinance which was confirmed by the Council of Ministers in a vote on 14 April. As a result, the decision to phase out refrigerants with fluorised greenhouse gases (F-gases) has come into force which is predicted to have a positive effect on Beijer Ref through the investments in new technology which the end customers will gradually need to make and where Beijer ref is well prepared for the new rules and regulations. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">On 14 May, the Swedish Companies Registration Office approved the Group&rsquo;s change of name from G &amp; L Beijer to Beijer Ref. A classic Swedish industrial company&rsquo;s modern operation is now also reflected in the company name.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">In July, Beijer Ref acquired the remaining 40 per cent of the shares in the Italian SCM Frigo Group, a leading manufacturer in Europe of, among other things, refrigeration units based on environment-friendly technology. The company reports sales of around SEK 240M and has 90 employees. The acquisition is deemed to have a positive effect on Beijer Ref&rsquo;s profit per share already in 2014. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">In August, Beijer Ref acquired all the shares in a leading refrigeration wholesaler in Norway, B&oslash;rresen Cooltech AS. B&oslash;rresen Cooltech reports sales of SEK 60M, has 20 employees and will be integrated into Beijer Ref&rsquo;s organisation. The acquisition is deemed to have a marginally positive effect on Beijer Ref&rsquo;s net income. B&oslash;rresen Cooltech is included in the consolidated accounts from August 2014.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">In September, Beijer Ref strengthened its position in the rapidly growing German refrigeration wholesale market when it acquired the net assets in Gr&uuml;n Gro&szlig;handel f&uuml;r K&auml;lte- und Klimazubeh&ouml;r. The company reports sales of approximately SEK 25M, has seven employees and gives the Group a strategically important presence in Stuttgart. The acquisition is deemed to have a marginally positive effect on Beijer Ref&rsquo;s net income. The company is included in the consolidated accounts from October 2014. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong>After the end of the reporting period</strong><br />In October, Beijer Ref acquired all the shares in the French refrigeration wholesaler, GFOI (G&eacute;n&eacute;rale Frigorifique Oc&eacute;an Indien). GFOI is located on the R&eacute;union Island approximately 800 kilometres east of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean. The company reports sales of around SEK 50M, has seven employees and is a step in the Group&rsquo;s expansion outside Europe. The acquisition is deemed to have a marginally positive effect on Beijer Ref&rsquo;s net income.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong>Risk assessment</strong><br />The operations of the Beijer Ref Group are affected by a number of external factors, the effects of which on the Group&rsquo;s operating profit can be controlled to a varying degree. The Group&rsquo;s operation is dependent on the general economic trend, especially in Europe, which controls the demand for Beijer Ref&rsquo;s products and services. Acquisitions are normally linked with risks such as, for example, staff defection. Other operating risks, such as agency and supplier agreements, product responsibility and delivery undertaking, technical development, warranties, dependence on individuals, etc., are continually being analysed and, when necessary, action is taken to reduce the Group&rsquo;s risk exposure. In its operation, Beijer Ref is exposed to financial risks such as currency risk, interest risk and liquidity risk. The parent company&rsquo;s risk picture is the same as that of the Group. For further information see the Group&rsquo;s Annual Report.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong>Financial information</strong><br />- The Year-end Report for 2014 will be published on 10 February 2015.<br />- The Annual Report for 2014 will be published in April 2015.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span><strong></strong></span></p><p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">The Swedish refrigeration group, Beijer Ref AB, is acquiring the remaining 49 per cent of the shares in the Italian SCM Frigo Group, a leading manufacturer in Europe of refrigeration units based on environment-friendly carbon dioxide technology. SCM Frigo, established in 1979, exports around 85 per cent of its products and has a strong market position within the rapidly expanding segment for environment-friendly refrigeration technology. The company reports sales of approximately SEK 240M and has 90 employees. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><em>&ldquo;Beijer Ref acquired 51 per cent of SCM Frigo in 2011 as it is one of the European companies which most successfully drives the transition to environment-friendly solutions within the refrigeration industry. The company&rsquo;s development has since been so positive that our Group now elects to bring forward the option to acquire the remaining portion,</em> says Per Bertland, CEO of Beijer Ref. <em>&rsquo;With its unique technical competence within, for example, trans-critical carbon dioxide based refrigeration systems, SCM Frigo is included as an important part in Beijer Ref&rsquo;s future strategy&rdquo;</em>. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">SCM Frigo supplements Beijer Ref&rsquo;s other product portfolio with standard products as well as customer-adapted solutions with the market&rsquo;s most up to date environmental technology. This is expected to strengthen the Group&rsquo;s competitiveness. SCM Frigo&rsquo;s company management will continue to work in the company. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">The acquisition is expected to have a positive effect on Beijer Ref&rsquo;s net result as early as 2014. SCM Frigo, which since 2011 has been consolidated in accordance with the acquisition method, will be included as fully consolidated without a minority share in Beijer Ref&rsquo;s accounts from Q3 2014.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><strong></strong></span><strong><span style="font-size: 12pt">Continued positive development for Beijer Ref</span></strong></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><strong>Quarter 2 2014</strong></span></p>
<ul style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">
<li><span style="font-size: 10pt">Net sales amounted to SEK 1,870.8M (1,711.9).<br />&nbsp;<br /></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 10pt">Operating profit amounted to SEK 136.9M (83.4). <br />&nbsp;<br /></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 10pt">Net profit amounted to SEK 89.3M (50.4). <br />&nbsp;<br /></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 10pt">Profit per share amounted to SEK 2.03 (1.14).<br />&nbsp;<br /></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 10pt">The positive trend continued for the second quarter with a growth in sales of nine per cent and an improved operating profit of 64 per cent compared with the corresponding quarter in the previous year. Excluding one-time costs in 2013, operating profit increased by 16 per cent. <br />&nbsp; <br /></span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 10pt">Strong increase of HVAC (comfort cooling) in Europe during the second quarter.</span></li>
</ul>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong>&nbsp; <br /><span style="font-size: 12pt">Comments by the CEO </span></strong></span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong>Continued positive trend in Europe</strong><br />The second quarter of 2014 consolidates the positive trend from the first quarter with a sales increase of 9.3 per cent. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">The operating profit of SEK 136.9M shows that Beijer Ref continues to strengthen its position as the largest refrigeration wholesaler in Europe. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Among our regions, Central Europe enjoyed a good development during the second quarter. The United Kingdom continued to develop positively with both increased sales and increased market share. In the UK, Beijer Ref&rsquo;s competitive distribution and service concept to nationally operating customers is achieving increased penetration in the market. Holland strengthened its position during the quarter and Germany continues its positive development. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Southern Europe accounts for around 40 per cent of Beijer Ref&rsquo;s sales and in this region both sales and results are also increasing. At this moment in time, Spain is the fastest expanding market in Southern Europe, especially with increased demand for HVAC (heating, ventilation and air conditioning, also called comfort cooling), which drives growth. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">In the Eastern European market, Poland is leading the development with a significant increase in sales within both commercial &amp; industrial refrigeration and HVAC. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">In the Nordic market, the trend in the Swedish market has been &lsquo;wait-and-see&rsquo;, but a strong end to the quarter is a positive signal. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Denmark and Finland developed well. Sweden and Norway started the quarter slightly weaker but turned the trend during June and there is reason for cautious optimism in both countries. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">In the Rest of the World, Thailand&rsquo;s development has stabilised after the recent disturbances and South Africa is developing according to plan. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">One contributing reason to the quarter&rsquo;s results, albeit a minor influence, is the positive currency effects of the stronger Euro, something that must be seen as welcome after a long period with the opposite situation. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong>Increased investment in refrigeration units produced by the company</strong><br />Refrigeration units produced by the company itself is a growing and increasingly prioritised segment within Beijer Ref. As one of the largest and most modern refrigeration wholesalers in the world, an understanding of our customers&rsquo; refrigeration requirements has been built up within the Group. We are transferring this refrigeration competence to a growing portfolio with refrigeration units produced by the company. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Our ambition is that Beijer Ref will increasingly be able to offer even more competitive energy-efficient solutions, both with regard to individual standard units and customer-adapted overall concepts with the most modern environment technology. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong>Toshiba increasingly strong brand within HVAC</strong><br />The demand for HVAC (comfort cooling) is slightly more dependent on the economic situation than other operations within Beijer Ref and, therefore, the increased sales during the second quarter within this market segment can be seen as a sign of a continued economic upturn in Europe. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Toshiba HVAC is one of the many world-leading brands within comfort cooling represented by Beijer Ref. Like Beijer Ref, the world-leading Japanese high-tech company, Toshiba, has its roots in the innovative company culture of the late 19th century. It currently consists of more than 740 companies with 210,000 employees all over the world. We are pleased to note the development for Toshiba&rsquo;s products within comfort cooling was strong in all markets during the second quarter. It should also be emphasised that our sales of both Samsung and Mitsubishi enjoyed a similar development. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong>Interesting acquisition opportunities</strong><br />With the European recession hopefully behind us, a stronger market position, increased operating margin, and positive effects of the previous year&rsquo;s cost savings, Beijer Ref has after the first two quarters of the year consolidated its operation and is well prepared for future acquisitions. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">It should also be mentioned that after 136 years of operation as G &amp; L Beijer, the Group officially changed its name to Beijer Ref which, as previously announced, better reflects the consolidated operation (ref = refrigeration). At the same time, the Group&rsquo;s new website was ready with more lucid and easily accessible information. Please visit our website on www.beijerref.com.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><em>Per Bertland<br />CEO, Beijer Ref AB</em></span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong>&nbsp; <br />Quarterly report Q2 2014</strong></span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong>About Beijer Ref</strong></span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Beijer Ref is one of the three largest refrigeration wholesalers in the world and the leading company in Europe. The Group offers competitive and innovative solutions within refrigeration and air conditioning with customer-adapted products, refrigeration units developed by the company itself and efficient logistics.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong>Sales</strong><br />Beijer Ref increased its sales by nine per cent to SEK 1,870.8M (1,711.9) for the second quarter of 2014. Adjusted for exchange rate fluctuations and acquisitions, the organic sales increase was four per cent. The Group also increased its sales by nine per cent to SEK 3,451.8M (3,175.7) for the period January to June which, organically, is an increase of five per cent. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Beijer Ref operates in three market areas: commercial &amp; industrial refrigeration and HVAC (comfort cooling). The Group splits its operation in the global market into five geographic segments: The Nordic countries, Central Europe (including the United Kingdom and Ireland) Eastern Europe, Southern Europe and the Rest of the World (currently consisting of southern Africa and Thailand). </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Behind the quarter&rsquo;s sales increase lies increased demand in virtually all of these markets, where especially Central Europe (including the United Kingdom and Ireland), reported strong growth. Eastern Europe also developed well, with Poland as the largest market. Southern Europe also enjoyed a positive development. HVAC, which accounts for approximately 30 per cent of Beijer Ref&rsquo;s sales, continued to increase during the second quarter. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong>Results</strong><br />The Group&rsquo;s operating profit amounted to SEK 136.9M (83.4) for the second quarter. The result increase can be explained as a combination of implemented savings measures taken during 2013, increased market share in the United Kingdom and strengthened demand, especially for HVAC, but also for commercial &amp; industrial refrigeration in Europe. In the previous year&rsquo;s figures, the operating result is charged with one-time costs of SEK 34.2M. Excluding these one-time costs, the operating profit for the second quarter of 2013 amounted to SEK 117.6M. For the first half year, the operating profit amounted to SEK 208.2M (132.1). Excluding one-time costs, the operating profit was SEK 166.3M in the previous year.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">The Group&rsquo;s financial income/expense amounted to SEK -8.6M (-9.6) for the second quarter. Profit before tax was SEK 128.3M (73.8). Profit after tax was SEK 89.3M (50.4). Profit per share amounted to SEK 2.03 (1.14). For the first half of the year, the Group&rsquo;s financial income/expense amounted to SEK -16.1M (-15.0). Profit before tax was SEK 192.1M (117.1). Profit after tax amounted to SEK 134.9M (82.8). Profit per share was SEK 3.06 (1.83).</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong>Other financial information</strong><br />Consolidated capital expenditure, including acquisitions, amounted to SEK 40.2M (34.4) for the first half of 2014. Liquid funds, including unutilised bank overdraft facilities, were SEK 373.6M (433.1) on 30 June 2014. Shareholders&rsquo; equity amounted to SEK 2,431.7M (2,247.5). The net debt was SEK 1,607.5M (1,479.3). The equity ratio amounted to 41.9 per cent (41.7). The average number of employees during the first half of the year was 2,169 (2,106).</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong>Significant events during the year</strong><br />In January, G &amp; L Beijer acquired all the shares in Eurocool (Pty) Ltd, a leading refrigeration wholesaler in South Africa. Eurocool was founded in 1999 and holds a strong market position within G &amp; L Beijer&rsquo;s priority segments. The company reports sales of approximately SEK 65M and has 36 employees. The acquisition is estimated to provide cost synergies, increased efficiency and increased purchasing volumes through co-ordination with Beijer Ref&rsquo;s existing operation in southern Africa. The acquisition is deemed to have a marginal positive effect on Beijer Ref&rsquo;s profit per share in 2014. Eurocool is included in G &amp; L Beijer&rsquo;s accounts from January 2014.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">On 12 March, the EU Parliament voted &lsquo;yes&rsquo; to the proposal about a new F-gas ordinance which was confirmed by the Council of Ministers in a vote on 14 April. As a result, the decision to phase out refrigerants with fluorised greenhouse gases (F-gases) has come into force which is predicted to have a positive effect on Beijer Ref through the investments in new technology which the end customers will gradually need to make and where Beijer ref is well prepared for the new business opportunities. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">On 14 May, the Swedish Companies Registration Office approved the Group&rsquo;s change of name from G &amp; L Beijer to Beijer Ref. A classic Swedish industrial company&rsquo;s modern operation is now also reflected in the company name.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong>Risk assessment</strong><br />The operations of the Beijer Ref Group are affected by a number of external factors, the effects of which on the Group&rsquo;s operating profit can be controlled to a varying degree. The Group&rsquo;s operation is dependent on the general economic trend, especially in Europe, which controls the demand for Beijer Ref&rsquo;s products and services. Acquisitions are normally linked with risks such as, for example, staff defection. Other operating risks, such as agency and supplier agreements, product responsibility and delivery undertaking, technical development, warranties, dependence on individuals, etc., are continually being analysed and, when necessary, action is taken to reduce the Group&rsquo;s risk exposure. In its operation, Beijer Ref is exposed to financial risks such as currency risk, interest risk and liquidity risk. The parent company&rsquo;s risk picture is the same as that of the Group. For further information see the Group&rsquo;s Annual Report.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span><strong></strong></span></p><ul style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">
<li><span style="font-size: 10pt"> Net sales amounted to SEK 1,581.0M (1,463.8).</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 10pt">Operating profit amounted to SEK 71.3M (48.7). </span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 10pt">Net profit amounted to SEK 45.6M (32.4). </span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 10pt">Profit per share amounted to SEK 1.03 (0.70).</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 10pt">The positive trend continued for the first quarter with a growth in sales of eight per cent and an improved operating profit of 46 per cent compared with the first quarter in the previous year.</span></li>
<li><span style="font-size: 10pt">Acquisition of the South African refrigeration wholesaler, Eurocool.</span></li>
</ul>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><strong>Comments by the CEO</strong> </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong>Economic thaw in Europe<br /></strong>After a challenging period with a crisis in the European economy and subdued demand during the second half of 2012 and the beginning of 2013, we note with cautious optimism that the first quarter of 2014 confirms a positive trend. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">The operating profit of SEK 71.3M shows that we have still some way to go to reach the levels of 2011 and 2012 but, nevertheless, it should be seen as a sign of an improvement. There are several reasons for this. The strongest reason could be that, after many years of economic crisis in Europe, the need for new investments in, and service of, existing refrigeration installations is now becoming so significant that it is no longer possible to postpone them. Furthermore, as the largest refrigeration wholesaler in Europe, Beijer Ref is well positioned to satisfy this requirement. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Among our market regions, the United Kingdom &amp; Ireland must be mentioned as markets to celebrate with strong growth. Spain and Italy have also revived, where a more positive trend has coincided with warm spring weather and the ensuing strong demand for both air-conditioning and refrigeration products. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong>Interesting development in southern Africa</strong><br />The work of integrating Eurocool, one of the largest refrigeration wholesalers in South Africa, has been intensive since the company was acquired in January 2014. Beijer Ref has a well-functioning acquisition strategy which, among other things, is aimed at creating synergies as soon as possible with regard to purchasing, distribution and the operation&rsquo;s costs. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">The acquisition strengthens our presence in the rapidly growing market for refrigeration and air-conditioning products is southern Africa. The end customers&rsquo; need for investment within all the three market segments within which we operate &ndash; commercial refrigeration, industrial refrigeration and comfort cooling &ndash; is rapidly increasing and, with our operations in South Africa, Namibia, Mozambique, Zambia and Botswana, we stand well equipped to meet the demand. The fact that Africa will be a significant part of Beijer Ref&rsquo;s growth in the future is, therefore, a safe prediction to make. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong>EU at the forefront of natural refrigerants</strong><br />In March and April this year, the EU Parliament and Council of Ministers, as anticipated, took the eagerly awaited decision to phase out fluorised greenhouse gases from refrigerants. This F-gas ordinance has a large number of time guidelines during the coming decades and will gradually replace the old technology&rsquo;s greenhouse-effect refrigerants with natural and environmentally sustainable alternatives.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">There are already natural refrigerants based on, for example, carbon dioxide or ammonia and innovations will no doubt continue at an ever increasing pace in the next few years. For Beijer Ref, the EU&rsquo;s decision is welcome as it puts a badly needed focus on the modern and more environment-friendly refrigeration technology with which we and our collaboration partners are ready to replace the old solutions. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong>New world, new opportunities &ndash; new name</strong><br />Ever since the brothers Gottfried and Lorens Beijer, for the first time, advertised under the company name &lsquo;G. &amp; L. Beijer&rsquo; in Sydsvenska Dagbladet in Malm&ouml; in 1878 it has been the company&rsquo;s name. Thereafter, all other Beijer companies operating in Sweden have developed from this Beijer heritage. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">We are building further on this proud trading tradition. However, with an international refrigeration wholesale and air-conditioning operation as the Group&rsquo;s primary focus, we have chosen to adapt the name in a way which more directly communicates what we do. The proposed new name is Beijer Ref, where Ref is well-known in this sector as an abbreviation for refrigeration. The decision regarding the change of name will be taken at the Annual Meeting of shareholders on 24 April.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><em>Per Bertland<br />CEO, G &amp; L Beijer AB</em></span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong>About Beijer Ref</strong><br />G &amp; L Beijer is one of the three largest refrigeration wholesalers in the world and the leading company in Europe. The Group offers competitive and innovative solutions within refrigeration and air conditioning with customer-adapted products, products of its own development and efficient service.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong>Sales</strong><br />G &amp; L Beijer (under a change of name to Beijer Ref) increased its sales by eight per cent to SEK 1,581.0M (1,463.8) for the first quarter of 2014. Adjusted for exchange rate fluctuations and acquisitions, the organic sales increase was 5.4 per cent. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Beijer Ref operates in three market areas: commercial refrigeration, industrial refrigeration and comfort cooling. The Group splits its operation in the global market into five geographic segments: The Nordic countries, Central Europe (including the United Kingdom and Ireland) Eastern Europe, South Europe and the Rest of the World (currently consisting of southern Africa and Thailand). </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Behind the quarter&rsquo;s sales increase lies increased demand in virtually all of these markets, where Central Europe as well as the United Kingdom and Ireland reported strong growth. Comfort cooling, which accounts for approximately 30 per cent of Beijer Ref&rsquo;s sales, reported strong growth for the first quarter, partly as a result of the warm spring weather in southern Europe. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong>Results</strong><br />The Group&rsquo;s operating profit amounted to SEK 71.3M (48.7) for the first quarter. The result increase can be explained as a combination of implemented savings measures taken during 2013 and increased sales as a result of accumulated investment needs within commercial refrigeration as well as industrial refrigeration and comfort cooling. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">The Group&rsquo;s financial income/expense amounted to SEK -7.5M (-5.4). Profit before tax was SEK 63.8M (43.3). Profit after tax was SEK 45.6M (32.4). Profit per share amounted to SEK 1.03 (0.70). </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong>Other financial information</strong><br />Consolidated capital expenditure, including acquisitions, amounted to SEK 28.4M (6.0) for the first quarter of 2014. The largest part of the increase compared with the previous year relates to acquisitions. Liquid funds, including unutilised bank overdraft facilities, were SEK 420.4M (629.1) on 31 March 2014. Shareholders&rsquo; equity amounted to SEK 2,467.2M (2,329.5). The net debt was SEK 1,234.8M (1,121.4). The equity ratio amounted to 46.6 per cent (47.4). The average number of employees during the period was 2,158 (2,116).</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong>Significant events during the first quarter<br /></strong>In January, G &amp; L Beijer acquired all the shares in Eurocool (Pty) Ltd, a leading refrigeration wholesaler in South Africa. Eurocool was founded in 1999 and holds a strong market position within G &amp; L Beijer&rsquo;s priority segments. The company reports sales of approximately SEK 65M and has 36 employees. The acquisition will provide cost synergies, increased efficiency and increased sales volumes through co-ordination with G &amp; L Beijer&rsquo;s existing operation in southern Africa. The acquisition is deemed to have a marginal positive effect on G &amp; L Beijer&rsquo;s profit per share in 2014. Eurocool is included in G &amp; L Beijer&rsquo;s accounts from January 2014.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">On 12 March, the EU Parliament voted &lsquo;yes&rsquo; to the proposal about a new F-gas ordinance which was confirmed by the Council of Ministers in a vote on 14 April. As a result, the decision to phase out fluorised greenhouse gases (F-gases) has come into force which is predicted to have a positive effect on Beijer Ref through the investments in new technology which the end customers will gradually need to make. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Beijer Ref is well prepared for this changeover to environment friendly refrigerants and is looking forward with confidence to the business opportunities which the new F-gas ordinance will involve. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong>Risk assessment</strong><br />The operations of the Beijer Ref Group are affected by a number of external factors, the effects of which on the Group&rsquo;s operating profit can be controlled to a varying degree. The Group&rsquo;s operation is dependent on the general economic trend, especially in Europe, which controls the demand for Beijer Ref&rsquo;s products and services. Acquisitions are normally linked with risks such as, for example, staff defection. Other operating risks, such as agency and supplier agreements, product responsibility and delivery undertaking, technical development, warranties, dependence on individuals, etc., are continually being analysed and, when necessary, action is taken to reduce the Group&rsquo;s risk exposure. In its operation, Beijer Ref is exposed to financial risks such as currency risk, interest risk and liquidity risk. The parent company&rsquo;s risk picture is the same as that of the Group. For further information see the Group&rsquo;s Annual Report.</span></p>

<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt">- Excluding one-time items, net profit amounted to SEK 269.2M (293.0). Including one-time items, net profit amounted to SEK 244.2M (305.8).</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt">- Profit per share amounted to SEK 6.10 (6.66) excluding one-time items. Including one-time items, profit per share amounted to SEK 5.51 (6.96).</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt">- Continued positive trend during the fourth quarter with a sales increase of three per cent compared with the corresponding quarter in the previous year. Operating profit increased by 18 per cent for the same period.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt">- The Board of Directors proposes a dividend of SEK 4.75 (4.75) per share.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt">- The South African refrigeration wholesale company, Eurocool, was acquired after the end of the reporting period.</span><span style="font-size: 10pt"></span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />G &amp; L Beijer is a technology-oriented trading Group which, through added-value products, offers competitive solutions within refrigeration and comfort climate.<strong></strong></span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong>Sales</strong><br />G &amp; L Beijer enjoyed a stable performance during the year. After the first six months, when several markets were characterised by weak demand, the trend turned upwards. The third quarter of the year was the Group&rsquo;s best so far, both from a point of view of sales and the results for the current operation. The fourth quarter remained positive which indicates some improvement in the market. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Consolidated net sales fell by two per cent to SEK 6,595.4M (6,758.3) for the 2013 full year. Organic sales were unchanged compared with the previous year. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Sales for the fourth quarter amounted to SEK 1,589.2M (1,543.3), an increase of three per cent in both reported and organic terms. Overall, the second half of 2013 was stronger than the first six months of the year, as well as in the same period previous year. South Africa is the region where sales improved most during the year. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">The weak demand that previously prevailed in Europe has improved. The Scandinavian countries, as well as the United Kingdom and Ireland, enjoyed a positive development, which, above all, can be attributed to the second half of the year. Southern Europe also shows signs of stabilisation. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong>Results</strong><br />Consolidated operating profit excluding one-time items for the 2013 full year amounted to SEK 411.9M (425.7). Including one-time items of SEK 34.2M, the result amounted to SEK 377.7M (415.2). The operating profit for the fourth quarter was SEK 98.9M (84.0), an increase of 18 per cent compared with the same period in the previous year. The improved result for the quarter is explained by a stabilisation of the market and by positive effects from the structural measures initiated during the second quarter. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">During 2012, a number of structural measures and cost savings were initiated aimed at mitigating the effects of the reduced demand in the market. Additional measures implemented in 2013 affect the result with one-off costs of SEK 34.2M for severance pay and restructuring. The implemented measures are estimated to generate annual cost savings of approximately SEK 50M, of which the majority have been realised and affect the result for 2013. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">The Group&rsquo;s financial income/expense amounted to SEK -31.1M (-10.3) for the full year and to SEK -7.4M (-8.0) for the fourth quarter. Financial income/expense for 2012 included capital gains of SEK 22.0M from the divestment of a participation in an associated company. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Profit before tax amounted to SEK 346.6M (404.9) for the full year and to SEK 91.5M (76.0) for the fourth quarter. Profit after tax amounted to SEK 244.2M (305.8) for the full year and to SEK 61.1M (49.6) for the fourth quarter. Adjusted for one-time items, profit for the year amounted to SEK 269.2M (293.0).</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Profit per share amounted to SEK 5.51 (6.96). Adjusted for one-time items, profit per share was 6.10 (6.66).</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong>Dividend</strong><br />The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual Meeting of shareholders resolves that a dividend of SEK 4.75 (4.75) per share shall be paid for the 2013 financial year. This is equivalent to a total of SEK 201.4M if the shares currently held by the company are excluded.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong>Other financial information</strong><br />Consolidated capital expenditure including acquisitions amounted to SEK 65.3M (88.3) for the full year. Liquid funds, including unutilised bank overdraft facilities, were SEK 563.2M (538.0). Shareholders&rsquo; equity amounted to SEK 2,417.0M (2,399.7) at the year end. The net debt was SEK 1,211.5M (1,228.5). The equity ratio amounted to 47.3 per cent (47.9). The average number of employees during the period was 2,137(2,141).</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong>Significant events 2013</strong><br />In April, G &amp; L Beijer acquired the Danish refrigeration wholesaler, FK Teknik, which reported sales of approximately SEK 32M in 2012 and showed good profitability. The company, founded in 1956, enjoys a very good reputation in the market. FK Teknik has five employees. The acquisition was a step forward in a consolidation of the Danish market. G &amp; L Beijer already has a strong position through its existing operation in Denmark. The acquisition is deemed to have a marginal positive effect on G &amp; L Beijer&rsquo;s profit per share. FK Teknik is included in G &amp; L Beijer&rsquo;s accounts from 1 April 2013.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">In June, the Board of Directors appointed Per Bertland as the new President and CEO of G &amp; L Beijer. Per Bertland took up his duties on 1 July 2013. He has worked in different functions within the G &amp; L Beijer Group since 1990. He has been Head of the Beijer Ref business area and a Member of the Executive Management.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong>Events after the end of the reporting period</strong><br />In January 2014, G &amp; L Beijer acquired all the shares in Eurocool (Pty) Ltd, a leading refrigeration wholesaler in South Africa. Eurocool was founded in 1999 and holds a strong market position within G &amp; L Beijer&rsquo;s priority segments. The company reports sales of approximately SEK 65M and has 36 employees. The acquisition is expected to provide cost synergies, increased efficiency and increased purchasing volumes through co-ordination with the company&rsquo;s existing operation in southern Africa. The acquisition is deemed to have a marginal positive effect on G &amp; L Beijer&rsquo;s profit per share in 2014. Eurocool is included in G &amp; L Beijer&rsquo;s accounts from January 2014. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong>Risk assessment</strong><br />The operations of the G &amp; L Beijer Group are affected by a number of external factors, the effects of which on the Group&rsquo;s operating profit can be controlled to a varying degree. The Group&rsquo;s operations are dependent on the general economic trend, especially in Europe, which controls the demand for G &amp; L Beijer&rsquo;s products and services. Acquisitions are normally linked with risks such as, for example, staff defection. Other operating risks, such as agency and supplier agreements, product responsibility and delivery undertaking, technical development, warranties, dependence on individuals, etc., are continually being analysed and, when necessary, action is taken to reduce the Group&rsquo;s risk exposure. In its operations, G &amp; L Beijer is exposed to financial risks such as currency risk, interest risk and liquidity risk. The parent company&rsquo;s risk picture is the same as that of the Group. For further information, see pages 40 and 58 in the Annual Report for 2012.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span><strong></strong></span></span></span></p>
<p><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt">A strong quarter</span></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Net sales increased by 12.3 per cent compared with the corresponding quarter last year and amounted to SEK 2,417M (2,153). The increase is mainly due to a continued positive development in the Southern Europe market region relating to air-conditioning products.</p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Operating profit amounted to SEK 186M (158). The improved profit is mainly the result of increased sales.</p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">In June, the UK Competition &amp; Markets Authority (CMA) approved the acquisition of HRP Ltd which was consolidated in the Group&rsquo;s operation from June.</p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Net profit for the period increased to SEK 121M (107).</p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Profit per share amounted to SEK 2.82 (2.48).&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 22pt">Comments by the CEO</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">A strong quarter </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">The second quarter of 2016 was our strongest quarter so far, mainly due to a good development in our largest region, Southern Europe. Markets which reported a weaker start to the year are beginning to gain speed and we continue to see a positive development, especially for sales of air conditioning. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Southern Europe enjoys organic growth of 18 per cent compared with the second quarter of 2015. Sales in Spain and Italy are performing very well and France is also enjoying a stable trend. The positive development in Germany for the first quarter was strengthened still further in the second quarter with a very strong sales and profit increase. In the Nordic markets, sales recovered in the second quarter and are now on a par with our expectations. However, we have not yet compensated for the weak start to the year. In Asia Pacific and Africa, the development continues in accordance with the plan. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">In June, the UK Competition &amp; Markets Authority (CMA) approved our acquisition of HRP Ltd and we will, therefore, be able to continue with the restructuring work in accordance with the plan. The operation in HRP was consolidated in the Group in June but this influences only sales, as HRP&rsquo;s operation in June generated a zero result. The resource-demanding CMA process had the effect that our other acquisition work slowed down during the period. However, we are now intensifying the work of identifying potential acquisitions in both new and existing markets. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Our results are to some extent affected by negative currency effects. The underlying negative currency effect is -3.6 per cent which is, however, some improvement compared with the previous quarter. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">The operating margin continues to increase which, in addition to the volume increase, is a result of the extensive review of our logistics flows initiated last year. As a result of this, we see an increased return on capital employed in operations. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">A large proportion of the sales increase is explained by increased demand for air conditioning. Toshiba, especially, but also other brands, contributed to the increase where the Southern Europe region remains the engine. During the period, sales of air conditioning increased by 40 per cent compared with the second quarter of 2015. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">We are continuing our work of developing our offer relating to eco-friendly and energy-efficient systems. The interest for these solutions is considerable, not least in Australia and New Zealand where this technology is still not established to the same degree as in the more mature European markets. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">The United Kingdom is an important market for us and we are keeping ourselves continually updated ahead of Brexit. Our operation in the United Kingdom mainly consists of commercial refrigeration, with an emphasis on the food sector. It is a long-term stable market and our current evaluation is, therefore, that Brexit will have a limited influence on our operation. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">We are now facing the third quarter which, together with the second quarter, is traditionally the most important period for us during the financial year. Last year&rsquo;s exceptionally warm weather in Southern Europe generated a strong sales increase, which had a significant influence on the profit for the third quarter of 2015. It remains to be seen if the weather this summer will be as favourable for Beijer Ref.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Per Bertland</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">CEO, Beijer Ref</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 22pt">Second quarter of 2016</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Sales</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Beijer Ref increased its net sales by 12.3 per cent to SEK 2,417M (2,153) for the second quarter of 2016. Adjusted for exchange rate fluctuations and acquisitions, the organic change in sales was 11.3 per cent. Behind the sales increase lies a strong development demand in Southern and Central Europe, especially with regard to air conditioning. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">For the first half of the year, net sales increased by 9.6 per cent to SEK 4,384M (3,999). Adjusted for exchange rate fluctuations and acquisitions, the organic sales change was 7.7 per cent.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt"> </span><span style="font-size: 11pt">Results</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">The Group&rsquo;s operating profit amounted to SEK 186M (158) for the second quarter, equivalent to an increase of 17.7 per cent. The result increase can mainly be explained by the strong development in demand in Southern and Central Europe. Italy and Spain enjoyed an especially positive development during the second quarter. Adjusted for exchange rate fluctuations and acquisitions, the organic increase in operating profit was 22.4 per cent. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">For the first half of the year, operating profit increased by 9.1 per cent to SEK 275M (252). Adjusted for exchange rate fluctuations and acquisitions, the organic increase in operating profit was 12.3 per cent. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">The Group&rsquo;s financial income/expense amounted to SEK -15M (-16) for the half of the year. Profit before tax was SEK 260M (236). Net profit for the period was SEK 182M (168). Profit per share amounted to SEK 4.17 (3.87).</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Cash flow</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Cash flow from the current operation before change in working capital is SEK 230M for the first half of 2016 compared with SEK 235M for the corresponding period in the previous year. During the first half of the year, the working capital increased by SEK 340M compared with SEK 191M for the same period in the previous year, mainly as a result of the increased business volume. This gives a cash flow from the current operation of SEK -110M compared with SEK 44M in the previous year.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Investments</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Consolidated capital expenditure, including acquisitions, amounted to SEK 54M (173) for the first half of 2016. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Significant events during the year </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">During the first quarter, the UK Competition &amp; Markets Authority (CMA) initiated an examination of our acquisition of HRP Ltd with 15 branches in the United Kingdom. On 8 June, CMA announced that it had no objections to the transaction. Our restructuring work could, therefore, continue in accordance with the plan. During the examination period, HRP was not included in the Group&rsquo;s accounts, but was consolidated in June. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Risk assessment</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">The operation of the Beijer Ref Group is affected by a number of external factors, the effects of which on the Group&rsquo;s operating profit can be controlled to a varying degree. The Group&rsquo;s operation is dependent on the general economic trend, especially in Europe, which controls the demand for Beijer Ref&rsquo;s products and services. Acquisitions are normally linked with risks such as, for example, staff defection. Other operating risks, such as agency and supplier agreements, product responsibility and delivery undertaking, technical development, warranties, dependence on individuals, etc., are continually being analysed and, when necessary, action is taken to reduce the Group&rsquo;s risk exposure. In its operation, Beijer Ref is exposed to financial risks such as currency risk, interest risk and liquidity risk. The parent company&rsquo;s risk picture is the same as that of the Group. For further information see the Group&rsquo;s Annual Report.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Accounting principles</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">This interim report has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34, the Swedish Annual Accounts Act and RFR 2. Beijer Ref continues to apply the same accounting principles as those described in the latest Annual Report, with the exception of what is stated below. New and amended standards applied from 1 January 2016 are not deemed to have any significant effect on the Group&rsquo;s or the parent company&rsquo;s results or financial position.</span></p>

<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Beijer Ref AB (publ) is pleased to announce that the UK Competition and Markets Authority (&ldquo;CMA&rdquo;) has today unconditionally approved its acquisition of HRP Holdings Limited (&ldquo;HRP&rdquo;). The acquisition of HRP was announced in November 2015 and completed in February 2016. However, the CMA launched an investigation on its own initiative into the merger under United Kingdom merger control laws.</p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">In reaching its decision, the CMA is satisfied that the merger will not substantially lessen competition <br />Beijer Ref can now proceed with its restructuring plans for the HRP business, which has been run <br />separately out of Beijer Ref&rsquo;s control during the CMA&rsquo;s investigation. The investigation started on 25 February 2016. HRP will be consolidated during June 2016.</p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Per Bertland, CEO of Beijer Ref Group, said that <em>&rdquo;we were highly confident that the acquisition of HRP would not reduce competition and are satisfied that the CMA has recognised this. My team and I can now get on and develop the HRP, 3D and HRP OEM brands&rdquo;.</em> He went on to say <em>&rdquo;I would like to take this opportunity to thank our suppliers, customers and employees for their understanding and support during this process.&rdquo;</em></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt">Stable start to the year</span></strong></p><p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Net sales increased by 6.6 per cent compared with the corresponding quarter of the previous year and amounted to SEK 1,967M (1,846). The increase is largely due to the previous year&rsquo;s acquisitions and organic growth in the Southern Europe market region as well as within the air-conditioning segment.</p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Operating profit amounted to SEK 89M (94). The lower result is mainly due to negative currency effects in South Africa and Norway.</p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Net profit was unchanged, SEK 61M (61).</p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Profit per share amounted to SEK 1.35 (1.39).</p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 22pt">Comments by the CEO</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Stable start to the year </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">The year has started with organic growth in most of our geographic markets and with a positive sales development of air-conditioning products. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Our largest region, Southern Europe, reports organic growth of six per cent compared with the first quarter of 2015. In Germany, we also saw a better than expected sales development, whilst our Nordic markets started the year slightly weaker than the previous year. This year, Easter fell in the first quarter which gives slightly fewer sales days than the corresponding quarter last year. We saw negative currency effects due to the weaker NOK. However, especially in Africa the result is affected by negative currency effects. Here, the ZAR has weakened so strongly that, in spite of organic growth of 13 percent, our sales was 15 per cent lower counted in SEK compared with the same period in the previous year. In Asia Pacific, the integration work of our new operations in Australia and New Zealand is proceeding in line with the plan and will contribute positively to sales and results during the year.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">During the period, we have seen a sales increase within air conditioning, where Toshiba and other brands are developing well with Southern Europe as the engine. During the period, sales of air conditioning increased by 19 per cent compared with the first quarter of 2015. Demand for air-conditioning products is to some extent cyclical and we now see the effect of the strengthened market development in Southern Europe. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">During the first quarter, we continued our work of developing our offer related to eco-friendly and energy-efficient refrigeration systems. We are also continuing our work of making our logistics flows more efficient, which will involve continued capital rationalisation. During 2015, the work on making our logistics flows more efficient generated a net decrease of SEK 140M in the working capital. During the first quarter of 2016, capital tied up continues to decrease. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">During Q1, the UK Competition &amp; Markets Authority (CMA) has initiated an examination of our acquisition of HRP Ltd with 15 branches in the United Kingdom. Our assessment is that the examination will be completed during the second quarter of this year and that the integration of the operation can then be initiated. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">April has started strongly and we enter the second quarter with confidence. We enjoy stable organic growth in many of our key markets. Our integration work in Asia Pacific is proceeding well, which could reduce the seasonal variations in the Group&rsquo;s sales in the long term. Taken together, 2016 looks like being an exciting year for Beijer Ref.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Per Bertland</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">CEO, Beijer Ref</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 22pt">First quarter of 2016</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Sales</span><span style="font-size: 11pt"></span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Beijer Ref increased its net sales by 6.6 per cent to SEK 1,967M (1,846) for the first quarter of 2016. Adjusted for exchange rate fluctuations and acquisitions, the organic change in sales was 3.3 per cent. Behind the sales increase lies a good development in the Southern Europe market region and stable organic growth in several other markets. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Results</span><span style="font-size: 11pt"></span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">The Group&rsquo;s operating profit amounted to SEK 89M (94) for the first quarter. The result decrease can partly be explained by currency effects in Africa and Norway, one-off expenses for legal advice in connection with CMA&rsquo;s examination of the acquisition of HRP Ltd in the United Kingdom and a slightly calmer first quarter in the Nordic countries. The newly-acquired companies in Australia and New Zealand have contributed positively to the result. When adjusted for exchange rate fluctuations, the organic decrease in operating profit was 5.3 per cent. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">The Group&rsquo;s financial income/expense amounted to SEK -4M (-9) for the first quarter. Profit before tax was SEK 85M (85). Net profit was SEK 61M (61). Profit per share amounted to SEK 1.35 (1.39).</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Cash flow</span><span style="font-size: 11pt"></span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Cash flow from the current operation before change in working capital was SEK 87M for the first quarter of 2016 compared with SEK 83M for the corresponding quarter in the previous year. The increase emanated mainly from lower tax payments in the current year. During the first quarter, the working capital increased by SEK 95M compared with SEK 74M in the previous year. This gives a cash flow from the current operation of SEK -8M compared with SEK 9M in the previous year. The first quarter of every year normally has a negative cash flow due to the build-up of working capital ahead of the strongest part of the year.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Investments</span><span style="font-size: 11pt"></span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Consolidated capital expenditure amounted to SEK 21M (154) for the first three months of 2016. No acquisitions were made during the period. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Significant events during the year </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">During the first quarter, the UK Competition &amp; Markets Authority (CMA) has initiated an examination of our acquisition of HRP Ltd with 15 branches in the United Kingdom. Our assessment is that the examination will be completed during the second quarter of this year and that the integration of the operation can then be initiated.</span><span style="font-size: 11pt"></span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Risk assessment</span><span style="font-size: 11pt"></span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">The operation of the Beijer Ref Group is affected by a number of external factors, the effects of which on the Group&rsquo;s operating profit can be controlled to a varying degree. The Group&rsquo;s operation is dependent on the general economic trend, especially in Europe, which controls the demand for Beijer Ref&rsquo;s products and services. Acquisitions are normally linked with risks such as, for example, staff defection. Other operating risks, such as agency and supplier agreements, product responsibility and delivery undertaking, technical development, warranties, dependence on individuals, etc., are continually being analysed and, when necessary, action is taken to reduce the Group&rsquo;s risk exposure. In its operation, Beijer Ref is exposed to financial risks such as currency risk, interest risk and liquidity risk. The parent company&rsquo;s risk picture is the same as that of the Group. For further information see the Group&rsquo;s Annual Report.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Accounting principles</span><span style="font-size: 11pt"></span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">This interim report has been prepared in accordance with IAS 34, the Annual Accounts Act and RFR 2. Beijer Ref continues to apply the same accounting principles as those described in the latest Annual Report, with the exception of what is stated below. New and amended standards applied from 1 January 2016 are not deemed to have any significant effect on the Group&rsquo;s or the parent company&rsquo;s results or financial position.</span></p>

<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">The Beijer Ref Group is focused on trading and distribution operations within refrigeration products, air conditioning and heat pumps. The product programme consists mainly of agency products from leading international manufacturers and, in addition, some manufacture of own products, combined with service and support for the products. The Group creates added value by contributing: technical competence to the products; accounting for knowledge and experience about the market; and by providing efficient logistics and warehousing.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Operations are carried out by region within the Beijer Ref, which comprises Beijer Ref ARW (Air conditioning, refrigeration, wholesale) and Toshiba&rsquo;s distribution operation within air conditioning and heating. The Beijer Ref Group is a leading operator within the refrigeration sector in Europe and has a significant position within air conditioning in Europe. The operation is split into six geographic segments: Nordic countries, Southern Europe, Central Europe, Eastern <br />Europe, Africa and Asia Pacific.

The Annual Meeting adopted the submitted profit and loss accounts and balance sheets for the Group and the parent company. The Board Members and the Chief Executive Officer were discharged from liability.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt">The Annual Meeting endorsed the Board of Directors&rsquo; proposal for a dividend of SEK 5,25 per share for the 2015 financial year and 11 April 2016 as the record day. The dividend is expected to be remitted by Euroclear Sweden AB on 14 April 2016.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt">In his speech at the Annual Meeting, the CEO of Beijer Ref, Per Bertland, gave an account of the company&rsquo;s operation during 2015, Beijer Ref&rsquo;s the best year ever from a results viewpoint. It included the establishment of operations in New Zealand, Australia, Malaysia and India. In addition, Per Bertland stated that Beijer Ref stands strongly equipped for a sustainable future and that the company is at the forefront for the development towards eco-friendly and energy-efficient refrigeration solutions. After the end of the financial year, the UK Competition &amp; Markets Authority, CMA, has begun an examination of Beijer Ref&rsquo;s acquisition of HRP. It means that the formal takeover will be delayed and is expected to take place in quarter 2. Beijer Ref is of the opinion that the acquisition will not influence the competitive situation in the United Kingdom. </span></p>

<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt">That the Directors&rsquo; fees shall be SEK 1,790,000. The Chairman will receive SEK 575,000 and the Board Members who are not employed within the UTC Group will receive SEK 285,000 each. </span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span><strong></strong></span></span></span></p>
<p></p><p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">The Election Committee in Beijer Ref AB has decided to put forward the following proposal to the Annual Meeting of shareholders relating to the number of Board Members and the election of Board Members. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">The Election committee proposes that the number of Members of the Board of Directors shall be seven. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">The Election Committee proposes the re-election as Board Members of Bernt Ingman, Joen Magnusson, Peter Jessen J&uuml;rgensen, Monica Gimre, Frida Norrbom Sams and Bill Striebe. In addition, the Election Committee proposes that Ross B. Shuster is elected as Board Member. Philippe Delpech does not stand for re-election. The Election Committee also proposes the re-election of Bernt Ingman as Chairman of the Board of Directors. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Based on the company&rsquo;s operation, its phase of development and market conditions in general, the Election Committee has discussed the Board of Directors&rsquo; diversity, size and composition relating to sector experience, competence, distribution according to sex, and international experience. To replace Philippe Delpech, who is not standing for re-election, the Election Committee has deemed it desirable to supplement the Board of Directors with an international Member with extensive sector experience of working in both Europe and Asia. Ross B. Shuster has many years&rsquo; experience gained from his work at United Technologies/Carriers operation in Asia and he took up a position as President International Operations in Asia, Europe, The Middle East and Canada, for UTC Climate Controls &amp; Security Business in 2015. The Election Committee is of the opinion that Ross B. Shuster&rsquo;s experience well meets the desired competence profile. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt">Ross B. Shuster,</span></strong><span style="font-size: 11pt"> born 1965, holds an MBA from University of San Francisco and a bachelor&rsquo;s degree in Mechanical Engineering from University of California. He has a long and extensive experience gained from leading positions within United Technologies Corporation (UTC) and Johnson Controls. Since October 2015, he has been President in International Operations of UTC&rsquo;s Climate, Controls &amp; Security business unit which includes Carrier air-conditioning operations. Ross B. Shuster has international experience of leadership in global groups with a focus on business development, organisation and sales in Asia, the Middle East, Canada and Europe. Ross B. Shuster is independent in relation to Beijer Ref and its management but dependent in relation to the company&rsquo;s largest shareholder. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">The Annual Meeting of shareholders will be held will be held at 3 pm on 7 April 2015 in Clarion Hotel &amp; Congress Malm&ouml; Live, Dag Hammarskj&ouml;lds torg 2, Malm&ouml;. Registration for the Meeting will start at 2 pm. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">In connection with the publication of the Notice of the Annual Meeting of shareholders on 9 March, the Election Committee&rsquo;s full proposal and justified statement will be made public.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 14pt"><strong>Continued positive development in Southern Europe</strong></span></p><p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt">Quarter 4 2015</span></strong><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt"></span></strong></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Net sales amounted to SEK 2,026.6M (1,789.7).</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Operating profit amounted to SEK 133.9M (115.5). </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Net profit amounted to SEK 84.0M (82.5).</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Profit per share amounted to SEK 1.95 (1.91).</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Sales growth of 13.2 per cent and operating profit improvement of <br />15.9 per cent compared with the corresponding quarter of the previous year. Organic increase in sales of four per cent and organic increase in operating profit of six per cent.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Agreement for the acquisition of the remaining 56 per cent of the shares in the UK refrigeration wholesale company, HRP Ltd, which will be finalized in 2016.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Acquisition of the remaining 40 per cent of the shares in the Thai company, PattonAero, which manufactures chillers, evaporators and condensers. </span></p>

<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Strong development in Southern Europe and Africa and continued positive development for the Toshiba distribution. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual Meeting of share&shy;holders resolves that a dividend of SEK 5.25 (5.00) per share shall be paid.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt">Comments by the CEO</span></strong><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt"> </span></strong></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp; We ended 2015 with a strong fourth quarter, with continued positive development for Toshiba and for the Southern Europe and Africa market regions. The sales increase for Beijer Ref amounted to 13 per cent, of which four per cent is organic and nine per cent consists of acquisitions. Operating profit increased to SEK 134M &ndash; an increase of 16 per cent compared with the corresponding period in 2014 and a figure which means that we make our highest annual profit ever. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt">Spain strong in Southern Europe</span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt"></span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp; Southern Europe is our most important market region and I am pleased that the strong demand in the region is maintained. In the fourth quarter, both Italy and France did well and especially Spain enjoyed a positive development. Africa&rsquo;s stable development also continues. In the fourth quarter, the Nordic markets were slightly weaker compared with the corresponding quarter in the previous year. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp; Apart from sales in the stronger market in Southern Europe, the positive development for Toshiba&rsquo;s sales is due to successful product launches. We have the sole right for the distribution of Toshiba&rsquo;s air-conditioning units and heat pumps in eleven countries in Europe. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt">Acquisitions in the United Kingdom and Thailand</span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt"> </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp; In November, Beijer Ref signed an agreement to acquire the remaining 56 per cent of the shares in the refrigeration wholesale company, HRP Ltd, which has 15 branches in the United Kingdom. Since its acquisition of Carrier&rsquo;s refrigeration wholesale operation in Europe and South Africa in 2009, Beijer Ref has owned 44 per cent of HRP. With HRP as a complement to the Group&rsquo;s existing UK refrigeration wholesalers, Dean &amp; Wood and RW Refrigeration, we consolidate our position in the United Kingdom. This also strengthens its position in Europe. HRP will be included in Beijer Ref&rsquo;s accounts in 2016.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp; Since our acquisition of Patton in spring 2015, we have owned 60 per cent of the shares in the Thai company, PattonAero, which manufactures chillers, evaporators and condensers. In December, we acquired the remaining 40 per cent of the shares in the <br />company. With its own manufacturing unit in Asia, this becomes another step forward in the development of Beijer Ref&rsquo;s OEM activity.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt">Important steps for eco-friendly refrigeration technology</span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt"> </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp; At the end of October, we received its first order for eco-friendly refrigeration systems through its subsidiary, Patton, in New Zealand. The refrigeration installation was manufactured by our Italian company, SCM Frigo, and installed in a leading food chain in New Zealand during the fourth quarter. This first order for eco-friendly refrigeration technology in Oceania is in line with our strategy to be a part of the changeover to eco-friendly refrigeration technology with its own manufacturing and, as a result, to <br />contribute to more eco-friendly refrigeration installations. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp; During the fourth quarter, were given the opportunity, through our Dutch refrigeration wholesalers, Coolmark and Uniechemie, to participate in a pilot project, initiated by a research team which had developed a new propane-based technology for more energy-efficient and eco-friendly refrigeration installations and which had sought to work in collaboration with us. The concept has been successfully launched in a leading food chain in Europe under the Triple Aqua brand. The interest is increasing and deliveries are also made to other customers. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp; Beijer Ref&rsquo;s Board of Directors proposes an increased dividend of SEK 5.25 (5.00). I am pleased with these positive events and a record profit. With a satisfactory fourth quarter and a new strong year for Beijer Ref, I look forward towards a year which is at least as exciting in 2016.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><em><span style="font-size: 10pt">Per Bertland</span></em></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><em><span style="font-size: 10pt">CEO, Beijer Ref AB</span></em></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt">About Beijer Ref</span></strong><span style="font-size: 11pt"></span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Beijer Ref is one of the largest refrigeration wholesalers in the world and the leading company in this sector in Europe. The Group offers competitive and innovative solutions within refrigeration and air conditioning providing customer-adapted products, chillers developed by the company itself, a high level of service and efficient logistics.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Beijer Ref operates in three market areas: commercial refrigeration, industrial refrigeration and HVAC (comfort cooling). The Group splits its operation in the global market into six geographic segments: Nordic countries, Central Europe, Eastern Europe, Southern Europe, A&amp;A (Africa and Asia) and Oceania.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt">Sales</span></strong><span style="font-size: 11pt"></span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Beijer Ref increased its sales by 13.2 per cent to SEK 2,026.6M (1,789.7) for the fourth quarter of 2015. Adjusted for exchange rate fluctuations and acquisitions, the organic change in sales was four per cent. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">The quarter&rsquo;s sales increase is mainly due to acquisitions, but also to a positive development, especially in Southern Europe and Africa, and to the distribution of Toshiba&rsquo;s air-conditioning products. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">For the period January to December, sales increased by 16.3 per cent to SEK 8,360.6M (7,189.0), which organically is an increase of four per cent. The year&rsquo;s sales increase is mainly due to strengthened demand during the hot summer in Southern Europe, combined with a stronger market in general and acquisitions.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt">Results</span></strong><span style="font-size: 11pt"></span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">The Group&rsquo;s operating profit amounted to SEK 133.9M (115.5) for the fourth quarter, equivalent to an increase of 15.9 per cent, of which 6.2 per cent is organic and 9.7 per cent relates to acquisitions. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">The Group&rsquo;s financial income/expense amounted to SEK -15.5M (-8.3) for the fourth quarter. The difference in the Group&rsquo;s financial income/expense is mainly due to acquisitions and allocations between the quarters. Profit before tax was SEK 118.4M (107.2). Net income was SEK 84.0M (82.5). Profit per share amounted to SEK 1.95 (1.91). For the twelve months of the year, the Group&rsquo;s financial income/expense amounted to SEK -42.3M (-34.9). The change consists mainly of increased interest expenses as a result of financing of acquisitions and translation differences on loans in foreign currency. Profit before tax was SEK 524.8M (446.5). Profit after tax amounted to SEK 373.1M (324.5). The increase in the year&rsquo;s tax expense is mainly due to profit increases in Southern Europe, which from a general point of view has higher corporation tax. Profit per share was SEK 8.64 (7.46).</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt">Dividend</span></strong><span style="font-size: 11pt"></span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual Meeting of shareholders resolves that a dividend of SEK 5.25 (5.00) per share shall be paid for the 2015 financial year. This is equivalent to a total of SEK 222.6M if the shares currently held by the company are excluded.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt">Other financial information</span></strong><span style="font-size: 11pt"></span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Consolidated capital expenditure, including acquisitions, amounted to SEK 316.6M (182.6) for the 2015 full year. Of this, the major portion refers to the acquisitions of Patton and Realcold. Shareholders&rsquo; equity amounted to SEK 2,634.2M (2,618.6). The net debt was SEK 1,483.7M (1,429.8). The equity ratio amounted to 43.6 per cent (46.0). The strong cash flow is mainly due to increased profit and improved working capital. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">During the autumn of 2015, Beijer Ref renegotiated its entire bank financing with its principal banks and increased the financing scope in order to have readiness for further expansion of the Group&rsquo;s operation. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt">Significant events during 2015</span></strong><span style="font-size: 11pt"></span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">In January, Beijer Ref signed an agreement with Carrier International Corporation, the world-leading American refrigeration group. The agreement gives Beijer Ref the exclusive right to distribute Carrier&rsquo;s DX product series within the comfort-cooling segment and to all pertaining service of these products in Europe. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">In February, Beijer Ref acquired all the shares in the refrigeration wholesale company, RNA Engineering &amp; Trading, which has its head office in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The company reports sales of approximately SEK 45M. It is the leading refrigeration wholesaler in the Malaysian market for commercial refrigeration, estimated to be worth nearly SEK 480M with stable growth of around ten per cent per annum. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">In March, Beijer Ref acquired all the shares in the refrigeration wholesale company, Patton, which has its head office in Auckland, New Zealand, and operations in New Zealand, Australia, India and Thailand. Patton was founded in 1923 and reports sales of approximately SEK 400M. It is the leading refrigeration wholesaler in New Zealand, with some sales of products manufactured by the company itself. The acquisition gives Beijer Ref a foothold in the important New Zealand, Australian and Indian markets and, at the same time, strengthens the existing operation in Thailand.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">In May, Beijer Ref expanded its OEM division through the formation of the company SCM Ref France which, with its registered office in Lyon, will focus on the development of an assembly operation for Beijer Ref&rsquo;s subsidiaries in Southern Europe. The Group transfers its collective refrigeration competence to a growing portfolio with products manufactured by the company itself, which has its starting point in the Italian company, SCM Frigo. In Sweden, the manufacturing company, SCM Ref Sweden, already exists. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">In June, Beijer Ref Poland signed its first order for carbon dioxide-based refrigeration systems, which is a step forward in the Group&rsquo;s ambition to contribute to eco-friendly refrigeration technology in Europe.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">In July, Beijer Ref acquired the refrigeration wholesale company, Realcold, which has its head office in Auckland, New Zealand, and around 20 branches in New Zealand and Australia.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">In October, Beijer Ref continued to develop its operation in Africa by establishing an operation in Ghana. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">In October, Beijer Ref also signed the first order for carbon dioxide-based refrigeration systems manufactured by the Group itself through its subsidiary, Patton, in New Zealand. The refrigeration installation is manufactured in accordance with modern refrigeration technology by Beijer Ref&rsquo;s Italian company, SCM Frigo, for installation in a leading food chain in New Zealand. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">In November, Beijer Ref signed an agreement to acquire the remaining 56 per cent of the shares in the refrigeration wholesale company, HRP Ltd, which has 15 branches in the United Kingdom. Beijer Ref has previously owned 44 per cent of HRP since its acquisition of Carrier Corporation&rsquo;s refrigeration wholesale operation in Europe and South Africa in 2009. As a result, Beijer Ref strengthened its position in Europe and, with HRP as a complement to the Group&rsquo;s existing UK refrigeration wholesalers, Dean &amp; Wood and RW Refrigeration, Beijer Ref consolidated its position as the market leader in the United Kingdom.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">In December, Beijer Ref acquired the remaining 40 per cent of the shares in the Thai company, PattonAero, which manufactures chillers, evaporators and condensers. The acquisition of Patton in March 2015 included an ownership of 60 per cent and, with a wholly-owned manufacturing company, the opportunity also increases for Beijer Ref&rsquo;s OEM division to develop eco-friendly refrigeration technology in Asia.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt">Risk assessment</span></strong><span style="font-size: 11pt"></span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">The operation of the Beijer Ref Group is affected by a number of external factors, the effects of which on the Group&rsquo;s operating profit can be controlled to a varying degree. The Group&rsquo;s operation is dependent on the general economic trend, especially in Europe, which controls the demand for Beijer Ref&rsquo;s products and services. Acquisitions are normally linked with risks such as, for example, staff defection. Other operating risks, such as agency and supplier agreements, product responsibility and delivery undertaking, technical development, warranties, dependence on individuals, etc., are continually being analysed and, when necessary, action is taken to reduce the Group&rsquo;s risk exposure. In its operation, Beijer Ref is exposed to financial risks such as currency risk, interest risk and liquidity risk. The parent company&rsquo;s risk picture is the same as that of the Group. For further information see the Group&rsquo;s Annual Report.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span><strong></strong></span></span></span></p>
<p></p><p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">The Swedish refrigeration group, Beijer Ref AB, is acquiring the remaining 56 per cent of the shares in the refrigeration wholesale company, HRP Ltd, which has its head office in Rougham and operates 15 branches in other locations throughout the United Kingdom. Following its acquisition of Carrier Corporation&rsquo;s refrigeration wholesale operation in Europe and South Africa in 2009, Beijer Ref already owned 44 per cent of HRP.</p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">As a result, Beijer Ref strengthens its position in Europe. In addition, HRP will act as a complement to the Group&rsquo;s existing UK refrigeration wholesalers, Dean &amp; Wood and RW Refrigeration Wholesale, and confirm the Group&rsquo;s position as the market leader in the United Kingdom.</p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">HRP (founded in 1945 as Headlands Refrigerator Parts) has 170 employees and annual sales of around SEK 500M. The company is a leading refrigeration wholesaler in the United Kingdom. It has a broad product range comprising around 10,000 products that include leading brand names such as Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Samsung, Toshiba, Danfoss, Copeland, Lawton, BOC, Aspera and L&rsquo;Unite.</p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">HRP has experienced profitability problems in recent years. The decision to acquire the remaining portion of HRP is based on the fact that Beijer Ref sees good opportunities for reversing this trend through the efficient co-ordination with the Group&rsquo;s existing UK refrigeration operations and by implementing a fully-comprehensive UK logistics network. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><em><span style="font-size: 11pt">&rdquo;With the acquisition of HRP, we consolidate Beijer Ref&rsquo;s operation in the important UK market. The three companies will continue to operate under their respective brands. However, through the joint group affiliation, we will be able to offer even better service and more efficient logistics, which improves our total offer in a competitive market,&rdquo;</span></em><span style="font-size: 11pt"> says Per Bertland, CEO of Beijer Ref. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">HRP Shareholder, Yvonne Curtis says: <em>&ldquo;The Board of HRP believes that becoming full members of the Beijer Ref team in the UK represents the best opportunity for the future development of HRP. With the skills and resources of a larger group behind us we will be better placed to address the new markets opening up in our business.&rdquo;</em></span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">With the acquisition, Beijer Ref&rsquo;s three UK companies will report sales of more than SEK 1.3 billion. As a result, the United Kingdom will be Beijer Ref&rsquo;s largest market in Europe after France. The parties have signed a binding agreement as of today and the takeover will take place on 1 January 2016. The acquisition is deemed to generate positive effects on both sales and results in the long term.</p>

<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt">Comments by the CEO</span></strong><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt"> </span></strong></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Beijer Ref&rsquo;s third quarter of 2015 showed a continued stable growth. The hot summer in Southern Europe, in combination with an improved economic cycle, confirms the upward trend with yet another strong quarter for Beijer Ref&rsquo;s largest market region, Southern Europe. This, in combination with a positive development in Eastern Europe, Thailand and Sweden, contributed to enabling Beijer Ref to increase its sales for the third quarter by 20 per cent. Of the sales increase, nine per cent is organic whereas seven per cent consists of acquisitions. The operating profit increased to SEK 180.7M &ndash; an increase of 15 per cent compared with the same period in 2014 - and represents a new record for Beijer Ref. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt">Strong quarter for Toshiba</span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt"> </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Beijer Ref&rsquo;s collaboration with the Japanese company, Toshiba, gives Beijer Ref the sole right in eleven countries in Europe for the distribution of the company&rsquo;s air-conditioning units, heat pumps and ventilation systems. The collaboration is both far-reaching and close, which gives Beijer Ref the opportunity to influence the product range and development. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">The Toshiba sales was also favoured by the hot summer in Southern Europe, as hot periods drive demand for air-conditioning plants. During the autumn, Toshiba is launching new products, which means that we are looking forward to the fourth quarter with confidence. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt">The acquisition of Realcold approved</span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt"></span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Beijer Ref&rsquo;s acquisition of the refrigeration wholesale company, Realcold, which has its head office in Auckland, New Zealand, and more than 20 branches in New Zealand and Australia, was approved by the competition authority in New Zealand at the beginning of October. As the conditions for the acquisition are, therefore, complied with, the work of completing the transaction and integrating Realcold with the previous acquisition of the refrigeration wholesale company, Patton, based in New Zealand and Australia now begins. Realcold will be consolidated into Beijer Ref&rsquo;s accounts during the fourth quarter of 2015.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Patton, which was acquired in March this year, has now sold its first chiller from Beijer Ref&rsquo;s sector-leading Italian manufacturing company, SCM Frigo &ndash; a synergy which is expected to increase in the future and is in line with Beijer Ref&rsquo;s OEM strategy. Both Patton and the refrigeration wholesale company, RNA Engineering &amp; Trading, which was acquired at the beginning of the year and has its head office in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, are developing well in accordance with the plan. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt">Global spread levels out the results</span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt"> </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Beijer Ref&rsquo;s strategy of global expansion through acquisition is partly aimed at levelling out seasonal variations. With operations in both the northern and southern hemisphere, these seasonally driven differences will reduce in the long term. The year&rsquo;s acquisitions of Patton, Realcold and RNA in Oceania were supplemented during the third quarter with the establishment of a new operation in Accra, capital of Ghana, in Africa. This is an exciting addition to our ongoing expansion in Africa for Beijer Ref as a modern and environment-conscious refrigeration group. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Our ambition is to continue this growth strategy and we look forward to being able to present additional acquisitions in the future.<em></em></span></p>

<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><em><span style="font-size: 10pt">CEO, Beijer Ref AB</span></em></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt">About Beijer Ref</span></strong><span style="font-size: 11pt"></span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Beijer Ref is one of the largest refrigeration wholesalers in the world and the leading company in this sector in Europe. The Group offers competitive and innovative solutions within refrigeration and air conditioning providing customer-adapted products, chillers developed by the company itself, a high level of service and efficient logistics.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt">Sales</span></strong><span style="font-size: 11pt"></span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Beijer Ref increased its sales by 20 per cent to SEK 2,335.4M (1,947.4) for the third quarter of 2015. Adjusted for exchange rate fluctuations and acquisitions, the organic change in sales was nine per cent. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">The Group increased its sales by 17.3 per cent to SEK 6,334.0M (5,399.3) during the period January to September which organically is an increase of five per cent. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Beijer Ref operates in three market areas: commercial refrigeration, industrial refrigeration and HVAC (comfort cooling). The Group splits its operation in the global market into six geographic segments: Nordic countries, Central Europe, Eastern Europe, Southern Europe, A&amp;A (Africa and Asia) and Oceania.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Behind this quarter&rsquo;s sales increase lies a positive development, especially in Southern Europe. The segment which showed the biggest increase within Beijer Ref during the quarter is air conditioning, demand for which was affected positively by the hot summer.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt">Results</span></strong><span style="font-size: 11pt"></span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">The Group&rsquo;s operating profit amounted to SEK 180.7M (157.8) for the third quarter. The result increase can mainly be explained by increased sales in Southern Europe. When adjusted for exchange rate fluctuations and acquisitions, the organic increase in operating profit was seven per cent.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">The Group&rsquo;s financial income/expense amounted to SEK -10.6M (-10.6) for the third quarter. Profit before tax was SEK 170.1M (147.2). Net income was SEK 121,3M (107.0). Profit per share amounted to SEK 2.82 (2.49). For the first nine months of the year, the Group&rsquo;s financial income/expense amounted to SEK -26.8M (-26.7). Profit before tax was SEK 406.4M (339.3). Profit after tax was SEK 406.4M (339.3). Net income amounted to SEK 289.1M (242.0). Profit per share was SEK 6.69 ( 5.56).</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt">Other financial information</span></strong><span style="font-size: 11pt"></span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Consolidated capital expenditure, including acquisitions, amounted to SEK 188.1M (136.5) for the first nine months of the year. Shareholders&rsquo; equity amounted to SEK 2,677.4M (2,457.5). The net debt was SEK 1,587.1 (1,528.9). The equity ratio amounted to 42.5 per cent (41.6). The average number of employees during the period was 2,419 (2,194).</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt">Significant events during the first nine months of the year</span></strong><span style="font-size: 11pt"></span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">In January, Beijer Ref signed an agreement with Carrier International Corporation, the world-leading American refrigeration group. The agreement gives the Swedish refrigeration wholesaler the exclusive right to distribute Carrier&rsquo;s DX product series within the comfort-cooling segment and to all pertaining service of these products in Europe. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">In February, Beijer Ref acquired all the shares in the refrigeration wholesale company, RNA Engineering &amp; Trading, which has its head office in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The company reports sales of approximately SEK 45M. It is the leading refrigeration wholesaler in the Malaysian market for commercial refrigeration, estimated to be worth nearly SEK 480M with a stable growth of around 10 per cent per annum. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">In March, Beijer Ref acquired all the shares in the refrigeration wholesale company, Patton, which has its head office in Auckland, New Zealand, and operations in New Zealand, Australia, India and Thailand. Patton was founded in 1923 and reports sales of approximately SEK 400M. It is the leading refrigeration wholesaler in New Zealand, with some sales of products manufactured by the company itself. The acquisition gives Beijer Ref a foothold in the important New Zealand, Australian and Indian markets and, at the same time, strengthens the existing operation in Thailand.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">In May, Beijer Ref expanded its OEM division through the formation of the company SCM REF France which, with its registered office in Lyon, will focus on the development of an assembly operation to Beijer Ref&rsquo;s subsidiaries in Southern Europe. The Group transfers its collective refrigeration competence to a growing portfolio with products manufactured by the company itself, modelled on the Italian company&rsquo;s, SCM Frigo, recipe for success. In Sweden, the manufacturing company, SCM REF Sweden, already exists. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">In June, Beijer Ref Poland signed its first order for carbon dioxide-based refrigeration systems, which is a step forward in the Group&rsquo;s ambition to be the driving force in the changeover to eco-friendly refrigeration technology in Europe.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">In September, Patton Australia sold its first chiller from Beijer Ref&rsquo;s sector-leading Italian manufacturing company, SCM Frigo, which can be seen as a breakthrough order. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">In September, Beijer Ref strengthened its operation in Africa by establishing an operation in Ghana.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">The refrigeration wholesale company, Realcold, which has its head office in Auckland, New Zealand, and around 20 branches in New Zealand and Australia was acquired in July. In October, after the end of the reporting period, the acquisition was approved by the competition authority in New Zealand. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt">Risk assessment</span></strong><span style="font-size: 11pt"></span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">The operation of the Beijer Ref Group is affected by a number of external factors, the effects of which on the Group&rsquo;s operating profit can be controlled to a varying degree. The Group&rsquo;s operation is dependent on the general economic trend, especially in Europe, which controls the demand for Beijer Ref&rsquo;s products and services. Acquisitions are normally linked with risks such as, for example, staff defection. Other operating risks, such as agency and supplier agreements, product responsibility and delivery undertaking, technical development, warranties, dependence on individuals, etc., are continually being analysed and, when necessary, action is taken to reduce the Group&rsquo;s risk exposure. In its operation, Beijer Ref is exposed to financial risks such as currency risk, interest risk and liquidity risk. The parent company&rsquo;s risk picture is the same as that of the Group. For further information see the Group&rsquo;s Annual Report.</span></p>

<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">The approval of the acquisition means that the integration of Realcold into Beijer Ref&acute;s existing business, Patton, can be started in both New Zealand and Australia.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span><strong></strong></span></span></span></p>
<p></p><p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">The Swedish refrigeration group, Beijer Ref AB, strengthens its operation in New Zealand and Australia by acquiring the refrigeration wholesale company, Realcold, which has its head office in Auckland, New Zealand, and around 20 branches in New Zealand and Australia.</p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Beijer Ref is one of the largest refrigeration wholesalers in the world and the acquisition of Realcold is a significant step forward in the company&rsquo;s strategy to grow outside Europe. Realcold was founded in 1955, reports annual sales of more than SEK 260M and is the second largest refrigeration wholesaler in New Zealand. With the acquisition, Beijer Ref becomes the largest refrigeration wholesaler in New Zealand.</p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><em>&ldquo;New Zealand and Australia are interesting growth markets for Beijer Ref. With the large food exports and growing tourism industry of these countries, there is a significant need for efficient refrigeration plants&rdquo;,</em> says Per Bertland, CEO of Beijer Ref.</p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">In New Zealand, Realcold has 10 branches, 68 employees and sales of SEK 135M.</p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">In Australia, the company has established an operation since 1999. Realcold has its distribution centre in Brisbane, eleven branches, 52 employees and sales of 157M.</p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><em>&ldquo;The company has a broad product portfolio with brands such as Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, Tecumseh, Emerson Copeland and Gree. However, the range will now be complemented with Beijer Ref&rsquo;s product programme. In addition to synergies on the purchasing side, we will contribute our European refrigeration-technology expertise and contribute with new eco-friendly refrigeration technology in New Zealand and Australia&rdquo;,</em> continues Per Bertland.<em></em></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">The acquisition of Realcold together with our acquisition of the refrigeration wholesale companies, RNA Engineering &amp; Trading in Malaysia and Patton in New Zealand, Australia, Thailand and India, during the spring has given Beijer Ref a stable foothold in the Australasia region, with total sales approaching SEK 800M.</p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Realcold will be integrated into Beijer Ref&rsquo;s organisation and is expected to be included in the consolidated accounts from October 2015. The acquisition is expected to have a marginal positive effect on Beijer Ref&rsquo;s net income in 2015. The acquisition is subject to approval by the competition authorities in New Zealand.</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 14pt"><strong>Southern Europe on the right track</strong></span></p><p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><strong>Quarter 2 2015</strong></span><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt"></span></strong></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Net sales amounted to SEK 2,152.9M (1,870.8).</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Operating profit amounted to SEK 158.3M (136.9). </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Net profit amounted to SEK 107.2M (89.3).</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Profit per share amounted to SEK 2.48 (2.03).</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Continued positive trend in the second quarter with sales growth of 15.1 per cent and an operating profit improvement of 15.6 per cent compared with the corresponding quarter in the previous year.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Strong development in the Nordic countries, a continued positive trend in Southern Europe and positive contributions from the acquisitions made during the first quarter in New Zealand, Australia, Thailand, India and Malaysia.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt">Comments by the CEO</span></strong><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt"> </span></strong></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Beijer Ref&rsquo;s second quarter in 2015 consolidates the positive trend from the first quarter. It is especially pleasing that Beijer Ref&rsquo;s <br />largest market region Southern Europe, which accounts for nearly 40 per cent of the Group&rsquo;s total sales, continues on a good trend. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Beijer Ref&rsquo;s operation is partly weather dependent and warm summers bring about increased sales, but the result in Southern Europe is especially due to an increased demand as a result of stronger markets. It seems as if the economic reform work, especially in Spain, but also in the other countries in the region, is beginning to impact, which gives a reason for cautious optimism about continued growth in Southern Europe. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">This, combined with continued strong growth in Sweden, the acquisitions made and continued good development in southern Africa, contributed to enabling Beijer Ref to increase its sales for the second quarter by 15.1 per cent and to an increased operating profit of SEK 158.3M &ndash; an increase of 15.6 per cent compared with the same period in 2014. This is the so far strongest quarter ever for Beijer Ref.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Beijer Ref&rsquo;s investment in carbon dioxide-based refrigeration systems continues to capture market share, especially in the Nordic countries. Compared with the second quarter in 2014, sales of eco-friendly refrigeration systems have trebled in Sweden, a success that can be attributed to the Group&rsquo;s investment in eco-friendly refrigeration systems developed by the company. This manufacturing is currently carried out in Italy, Sweden and, since May, also in France, where the newly established manufacturing company, SCM REF France, delivers chillers to the Beijer Ref companies in Southern Europe. Beijer Ref&rsquo;s OEM investment continues with expansion in additional geographic markets. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt">Breakthrough order in Poland</span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt"> </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">In Central Europe, especially Holland and Belgium report stable growth. In Eastern Europe, the market concern that can be attributed to the Ukraine crisis remains evident. However, a gratifying and future-oriented message came at the beginning of July when Beijer Ref in Poland signed its first order for carbon dioxide-based refrigeration systems. These are manufactured by Beijer Ref&rsquo;s OEM division and installed in a logistics centre for a leading food chain in Europe. Beijer Ref&rsquo;s objective is to be a proactive participant in the changeover to eco-friendly refrigeration technology in Europe. The Polish order should be regarded as something of a breakthrough in the Polish refrigeration market. Beijer Ref has previously delivered carbon dioxide-based refrigeration systems manufactured by the company in the Estonian and Latvian markets. The company&rsquo;s own manufacturing of eco-friendly refrigeration systems are currently growing faster than any other activity. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt">Successful integration of acquisitions</span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt"></span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">The acquisitions made in the first quarter &ndash; of the refrigeration wholesaler Patton&rsquo;s operations in New Zealand, Australia, Thailand and India, and of RNA Engineering &amp; Trading in Malaysia &ndash; are already well integrated within the Beijer Ref organisation and the work involved with the realisation of synergies continues. For example, the production in Thailand is under evaluation for the possible introduction of European technology. All one-off and structural costs related to the acquisitions are taken in the second quarter. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt">Hot July bodes well</span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt"> </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">With an initially hot July in Southern Europe, the continuing general strong market development and a breakthrough for eco-friendly refrigeration systems in Poland, I am looking forward with confidence to the third quarter for Beijer Ref.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><em><span style="font-size: 10pt">Per Bertland</span></em></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><em><span style="font-size: 10pt">CEO, Beijer Ref AB</span></em></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt">About Beijer Ref</span></strong><span style="font-size: 11pt"></span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Beijer Ref is one of the largest refrigeration wholesalers in the world and the leading company in this sector in Europe. The Group offers competitive and innovative solutions within refrigeration and air conditioning providing customer-adapted products, chillers developed by the company itself, a high level of service and efficient logistics.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt">Sales</span></strong><span style="font-size: 11pt"></span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Beijer Ref increased its sales by 15.1 per cent to SEK 2,152.9M (1,870.8) for the second quarter of 2015. Adjusted for exchange rate fluctuations and acquisitions, the organic change in sales was three per cent. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">The Group increased its sales by 15.8 per cent to SEK 3,998.6M (3,451.8) during the period January to June which organically is an increase of two per cent. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Beijer Ref operates in three market areas: commercial refrigeration, industrial refrigeration and HVAC (comfort cooling). The Group splits its operation in the global market into six geographic segments: The Nordic countries, Central Europe, Eastern Europe, Southern Europe, A&amp;A (Africa and Asia) and Oceania.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Behind this quarter&rsquo;s sales increase lies a positive development in Southern Europe, the Nordic countries and A&amp;A as well as acquisitions. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt">Results</span></strong><span style="font-size: 11pt"></span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">The Group&rsquo;s operating profit amounted to SEK 158.3M (136.9) for the second quarter. The result increase can mainly be explained by increased activity in the Nordic countries, Southern Europe and South Africa as well as acquisitions.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">For the first six months, operating profit amounted to 252.5M (208.2). The main reason why the increase in the profit calculated as a percentage was not higher in relation to the sales increase is that the majority of the sales increase comes from acquisitions and currency effects. The acquisitions give the same proportional increase in the profit as in the sales as the margins of the acquisitions are close to the Group&rsquo;s total margin. Exchange rate fluctuations have the same percentage effect on the sales as on the profit as long as this has largely the same distribution as the sales, which is the case.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">The Group&rsquo;s financial income/expense amounted to SEK -6.9M (-8.6) for the second quarter. Profit before tax was SEK 151.3M (128.3). Net profit was SEK 107.2M (89.3). Profit per share amounted to SEK 2.48 (2.03). For the first six months of the year, the Group&rsquo;s financial income/expense amounted to SEK -16.2M (-16.1). Profit before tax was SEK 236.3M (192.1). Net profit amounted to SEK 167.7M (134.9). Profit per share was SEK 3.87 (3.06).</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt">Other financial information</span></strong><span style="font-size: 11pt"></span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Consolidated capital expenditure, including acquisitions, amounted to SEK 172.6M (40.2) for the first six months of the year. Shareholders&rsquo; equity amounted to SEK 2,588.9M (2,431.7). The net debt was SEK 1,776.3M (1,607.5). The equity ratio amounted to 40.7 per cent (41.9). The average number of employees during the period was 2,361 (2,169).</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt">Significant events during the first six months of the year</span></strong><span style="font-size: 11pt"></span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">In January, Beijer Ref signed an agreement with, Carrier International Corporation, the world-leading American refrigeration group. The agreement gives the Swedish refrigeration wholesaler the exclusive right to distribute Carrier&rsquo;s DX product series within the comfort-cooling segment and to all pertaining service of these products in Europe. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">In February, Beijer Ref acquired all the shares in the refrigeration wholesale company, RNA Engineering &amp; Trading, which has its head office in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The company reports sales of approximately SEK 45M. It is the leading refrigeration wholesaler in the Malaysian market for commercial refrigeration. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">In March, Beijer Ref acquired all the shares in the refrigeration wholesale company, Patton, which has its head office in Auckland, New Zealand, and operations in New Zealand, Australia, India and Thailand. Patton was founded in 1923 and reports sales of approximately SEK 400M. It is the leading refrigeration wholesaler in New Zealand, with some sales of products manufactured by the company itself. The acquisition gives Beijer Ref a foothold in the important New Zealand, Australian and Indian markets and, at the same time, strengthens the existing operation in Thailand.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">In May, Beijer Ref expanded its OEM division through the formation of the company SCM REF France which, with its registered office in Lyon, will focus on the development of an assembly operation to Beijer Ref&rsquo;s subsidiaries in Southern Europe. The Group transfers its collective refrigeration competence to a growing portfolio with products manufactured by the company itself, modelled on the Italian company&rsquo;s, SCM Frigo, recipe for success. In Sweden, the manufacturing company, SCM REF Sweden, already exists. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">In June, Beijer Ref Poland signed its first order for carbon dioxide-based refrigeration systems, which is a step forward in the Group&rsquo;s ambition to participate in the changeover to eco-friendly refrigeration technology in Europe.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt">Risk assessment</span></strong><span style="font-size: 11pt"></span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">The operation of the Beijer Ref Group is affected by a number of external factors, the <br />effects of which on the Group&rsquo;s operating profit can be controlled to a varying degree. The Group&rsquo;s operation is dependent on the general economic trend, especially in Europe, which controls the demand for Beijer Ref&rsquo;s products and services. Acquisitions are normally linked with risks such as, for example, staff defection. Other operating risks, such as agency and supplier agreements, product responsibility and delivery undertaking, technical development, warranties, dependence on individuals, etc., are continually being analysed and, when necessary, action is taken to reduce the Group&rsquo;s risk exposure. In its operation, Beijer Ref is exposed to financial risks such as currency risk, interest risk and liquidity risk. The parent company&rsquo;s risk picture is the same as that of the Group. For further information see the Group&rsquo;s Annual Report.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 14pt"><strong>Oceania &ndash; a new market</strong></span></p><p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt">Quarter 1 2015</span></strong><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt"></span></strong></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Net sales amounted to SEK 1,845.7M (1,581.0).</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Operating profit amounted to SEK 94.2M (71.3). </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Net profit amounted to SEK 60.5M (45.6). </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Profit per share amounted to SEK 1.39 (1.03).</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Sales growth of 16.7 per cent and an operating profit improvement of 32.1 per cent compared with the corresponding quarter in the previous year. Organic increase in sales of 2.5 per cent and an organic increase in operating profit of 10.0 per cent.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Acquisition of the refrigeration wholesaler, RNA Engineering &amp; Trading, in Malaysia.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Acquisition of the refrigeration wholesaler, Patton, in New Zealand, Australia, Thailand and India. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Exclusive distribution agreement with the American refrigeration group, Carrier International Corporation, for comfort cooling products in Europe.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt">Comments by the CEO</span></strong><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt"> </span></strong></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt">Southern Europe thaws out? </span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt"></span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Beijer Ref started 2015 with a strong first quarter where, maybe, the biggest cause for rejoicing is that Southern Europe &ndash; which accounts for approximately 40 per cent of the Group&rsquo;s total sales &ndash; shows signs of recovery from the recession that began with the financial crisis in 2008. This, combined with the fact that the acquisitions made during 2014 and in the first quarter of 2015, contributes positively to the result. The market again shows underlying strength and prices for refrigerants are increasing. These are the contributing factors that enabled Beijer Ref to increase its sales for the first quarter by 16.7 per cent and to achieve an operating profit of SEK 94.2M &ndash; an increase of 32.1 per cent compared with the corresponding period in 2014. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Nordic markets also enjoyed a strong opening of the year, not least because eco-friendly refrigeration systems of Beijer Ref&rsquo;s own development continue to gain ground. The Group&rsquo;s strategy, with an increased focus on own manufacturing of eco-friendly <br />refrigeration systems, has had a promising start. The Scandinavian countries are at the forefront in the changeover to the new <br />technology. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In Central Europe, operations also remain stable and Beijer Ref can now be said to have gained a foothold in the important <br />German market. In Germany, we established an operation as late as in 2012. Since then Beijer Ref in Germany has reported growth. Holland and Belgium also report growth whereas the United Kingdom has stagnated slightly. Eastern Europe is developing posi&shy;tively, albeit at a slower rate. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As I have already stated, the biggest cause for rejoicing in Europe is Southern Europe where France and Italy especially are again enjoying growth after a relatively long period of stagnation. In addition to stronger markets, implemented market investments are beginning to generate results. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In A&amp;A (Africa and Asia), South Africa continues its positive development and there appears to be good prospects for further strengthening its positions in the neighbouring countries of Botswana, Namibia, Mozambique and Zambia. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt">The expansion continues</span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt"></span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">All companies acquired during 2014 are integrated into the Beijer Ref organisation and the Group is looking forward towards new opportunities to expand, both inside and outside Europe. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the European markets, the year started well with the important news that Beijer Ref and the world-leading American <br />refrigeration group, Carrier International Corporation, have signed an exclusive distribution agreement which gives Beijer Ref the distribution rights in most European countries for Carrier&rsquo;s competitive DX production series, including spare parts, within the comfort cooling segment. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon thereafter, the Group strengthened its position in Asia. At the same time, Oceania became a new part of the global <br />operation following the acquisition of Patton, the leading refrigeration wholesaler in New Zealand. The acquisition also comprises Patton&rsquo;s companies in Australia, Thailand and India, which is fully in line with Beijer Ref&rsquo;s strategy to grow outside Europe.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The refrigeration wholesaler, RNA Engineering &amp; Trading in Malaysia, was also acquired during the first quarter. This <br />complements both Beijer Ref&rsquo;s existing operation in Thailand and the acquisition of Patton&rsquo;s four companies in Asia and Oceania. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt">Continued aggressive investment</span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt"> </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">The European logistics project, which was initiated during the second half of 2014, continues according to plan. A comprehensive software system is being implemented in some of the largest markets in Southern and Central Europe, with the aim of reducing<br /> capital tied up through more efficient logistics. The signals from the countries which have made most progress are promising.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The positive market development, the opportunities for new interesting acquisitions and the effects of the favourable currency effects as a result of the weak SEK all indicate that, at this moment in time, we can look forward to the next quarter with cautious optimism. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><em><span style="font-size: 10pt">Per Bertland</span></em></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><em><span style="font-size: 10pt">CEO, Beijer Ref AB</span></em></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt">About Beijer Ref</span></strong><span style="font-size: 11pt"></span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Beijer Ref is one of the largest refrigeration wholesalers in the world and the leading company in Europe. The Group offers competitive and innovative solutions within refrigeration and air conditioning providing customer-adapted products, environment-friendly and energy-efficient chillers developed by the company itself and an efficient service.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt">Sales</span></strong><span style="font-size: 11pt"></span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Beijer Ref increased its sales by 16.7 per cent to SEK 1,845.7M (1,581.0) for the first quarter of 2015. Adjusted for exchange rate fluctuations and acquisitions, the organic change in sales was 2.5 per cent. The acquired growth was 4.1 per cent.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Beijer Ref operates in three market areas: commercial refrigeration, industrial refrigeration and HVAC (comfort cooling). The Group splits its operation in the global market into six geographic segments: The Nordic countries, Central Europe, Eastern Europe, Southern Europe, A&amp;A (Africa and Asia) and Oceania. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Behind the quarter&rsquo;s sales increase lies a positive development in Southern and Central Europe, the Nordic countries and A&amp;A, acquisitions and the weaker SEK.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt">Results</span></strong></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">The Group&rsquo;s operating profit amounted to SEK 94.2M (71.3) for the first quarter. The result increase can mainly be explained by increased sales in the Nordic countries, Southern and Central Europe and South Africa. When adjusted for exchange rate fluctuations and acquisitions, the organic increase in operating profit was 10.0 per cent.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">The Group&rsquo;s financial income/expense amounted to SEK -9.3M (-7.5) for the first quarter. Increased debt because of acquisitions explains the difference. Profit before tax was SEK 84.9M (63.8). Profit after tax was SEK 60.5M (45.6). Profit per share amounted to SEK 1.39 (1.03). </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt">Other financial information</span></strong></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Consolidated capital expenditure, including acquisitions, amounted to SEK 153.6M (28.4) for the first three months of 2015. Of this, the major portion refers to the acquisition of Patton. Liquid funds, including unutilised bank overdraft facilities, were SEK 618.6M (420.4) on 31 March 2015. Shareholders&rsquo; equity amounted to SEK 2,733.6M (2,467.2). The net debt was SEK 1,550.0M (1,234.8). The equity ratio amounted to 44.0 per cent (46.6). The average number of employees during the period was 2,243 (2,158).</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt">Significant events during the year</span></strong></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">In January, Beijer Ref signed an agreement with the world-leading American refrigeration group, Carrier International Corporation. The agreement gives the Swedish refrigeration wholesaler the exclusive right to distribute Carrier&rsquo;s DX product series within the comfort cooling segment, and all pertaining service of these products in Europe. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">In February, Beijer Ref acquired all the shares in the refrigeration wholesale company, RNA Engineering &amp; Trading, which has its head office in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The company reports sales of approximately SEK 45M. It is the leading refrigeration whole&shy;saler in the Malaysian market for commercial refrigeration, which is estimated to be worth nearly SEK 480M with a stable growth of around ten per cent per annum. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">In March, Beijer Ref acquired all the shares in the refrigeration wholesale company, Patton, which has its head office in Auckland, New Zealand, and operations in New Zealand, Australia, India and Thailand. Patton was founded in 1923 and reports sales of approximately SEK 400M. It is the leading refrigeration wholesaler in New Zealand with some sales of products manufactured by the company itself. The acquisition gives Beijer Ref a foothold in the important New Zealand, Australian and Indian markets and, at the same time, strengthens the existing operation in Thailand.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><strong><span style="font-size: 11pt">Risk assessment</span></strong><span style="font-size: 11pt"></span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">The operation of the Beijer Ref Group is affected by a number of external factors, the effects of which on the Group&rsquo;s operating profit can be controlled to a varying degree. The Group&rsquo;s operation is dependent on the general economic trend, especially in Europe, which controls the demand for Beijer Ref&rsquo;s products and services. Acquisitions are normally linked with risks such as, for example, staff defection. Other operating risks, such as agency and supplier agreements, product responsibility and delivery undertaking, technical development, warranties, dependence on individuals, etc., are continually being analysed and, when necessary, action is taken to reduce the Group&rsquo;s risk exposure. In its operation, Beijer Ref is exposed to financial risks such as currency risk, interest risk and liquidity risk. The parent company&rsquo;s risk picture is the same as that of the Group. For further information see the Group&rsquo;s Annual Report.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span><strong></strong></span></span></span></p>
<p></p><p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Today, 9 April 2015, Beijer Ref AB (publ) held its Annual Meeting of shareholders for the 2014 financial year. The Annual Meeting adopted the submitted profit and loss accounts and balance sheets for the Group and the parent company. The Board Members and the Chief Executive Officer were discharged from liability.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></p>

The dividend is expected to be remitted by Euroclear Sweden AB on 16 April 2015.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">In his speech at the Annual Meeting, the CEO of Beijer Ref, Per Bertland, gave an account of the company&rsquo;s operation during 2014 and for the first quarter of 2015.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"></p><p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><em><span style="font-size: 14pt">Beijer Ref is carrying out a key acquisition in its expansion outside Europe and acquires operations in three new markets: New Zealand, Australia and India.</span></em><span style="font-size: 10pt"></span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">The Swedish refrigeration group, Beijer Ref AB, is acquiring all the shares in the refrigeration wholesale company, Patton, which has its head office in Auckland, New Zealand and operations in New Zealand, Australia, India and Thailand.</p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Beijer Ref is one of the largest refrigeration wholesalers in the world and the acquisition is a significant step forward in the company&rsquo;s strategy to continue its growth outside Europe.</p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><em>&rdquo;This is a key acquisition which gives us a foothold in the important markets New Zealand, Australia and India and, at the same time, strengthens our existing operation in Thailand. Patton is an established company with a long tradition and a strong growth potential in its markets. The company eminently fits our profile&rdquo;,</em> says Per Bertland, CEO of Beijer Ref.</p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Patton was founded in 1923, reports sales of approximately SEK 400M and is the leading refrigeration wholesaler in New Zealand. Patton&rsquo;s sales include products manufactured by the company itself. These are marketed under the Patton brand. The company has also established platforms for growth in Australia, India and Thailand.</p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">&bull; In New Zealand, the company has nine branches, 65 employees and sales of SEK 175M. New Zealand&rsquo;s economy is strongly dependent on food exports and access to efficient refrigeration installations are a decisive factor. The tourist industry is also increasing, which generates an increased demand for refrigeration installations and air conditioning. With around 35 per cent of the market, Patton is the leading refrigeration wholesaler in the country.</p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">&bull; In Australia, the company has established an operation with 14 branches, 53 employees and sales of SEK 190M since 1985. Patton is currently a significant refrigeration wholesaler in Australia.</p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">&bull; In Thailand, Patton has had an operation for the manufacturing of its own refrigeration products since 2007. It has sales of SEK 30M, 62 employees and is operated through the joint-venture company, Patton Aero. The products are mainly sold in India, the Middle East, South East Asia and Australia. In 2014, the company moved into new premises of 3,700 square metres which will enable the company to triple its current production.</p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">&bull; In India, Patton has established an operation with five branches, 22 employees and sales of SEK 15M. India is the largest producer in the world of milk, fruit and vegetables. One important issue for the authorities is to limit food waste through an improved infrastructure. In this respect, the investment in efficient refrigeration installations is a vital component.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Patton has a broad product portfolio with brands such as Mitsubishi Electric, Emerson, Embraco and Than.</p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><em>&rdquo;Beijer Ref complements Patton&rsquo;s current product supply with several strong international brands, which are currently missing in its product portfolio. It means that Beijer Ref, with its overall product offer, will become more competitive in these markets. In addition, we see synergies on the purchasing side as well as on the production side&rdquo;,</em> continues Per Bertland.</p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Patton will be integrated into Beijer Ref&rsquo;s organisation and is expected to be included in the consolidated accounts from March 2015. The acquisition is estimated to have a positive effect on Beijer Ref&rsquo;s net income in 2015. Patton&rsquo;s management will continue to take an active part in the company.</p>

<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>New proposal:</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><em><span>The company shall, directly or indirectly, conduct trade in and develop, design and manufacture components, products and systems for air conditioning, heat pumps and refrigeration and other activities that can supplement the aforementioned business activities. The company shall also own and manage immovable and movable property and shares in commercial companies. </span></em></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>B)</span><strong> </strong><span>The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting passes a resolution regarding amendment to the Articles of Association on account of the proposed share split. The Board&rsquo;s proposal means that the limits for number of shares in Para 5 are amended so that the lowest number of shares shall be 34,000,000 and the highest number of shares shall be 136,000,000.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif">For the resolution regarding amendment to the Articles of Association under this item to be valid, the resolution must be supported by shareholders representing at least two thirds of the votes cast and the shares represented at the Annual Meeting. The Board of Directors&rsquo; proposal under items 14 and 15 also includes authorisation for the CEO to make any minor adjustments in the Annual Meeting&rsquo;s resolutions which may be necessary in connection with registration at the Company Registration or Euroclear</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif">Item16: Decision regarding Board of Director&rsquo;s proposal for introduction of a long-term, share-based incentive scheme.</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif">The Board of Directors proposes that the 2018 Annual General Meeting passes a resolution to adopt a long-term, share-based incentive scheme (&ldquo;the Scheme&rdquo;). The scheme, which it is proposed will include around 70 key individuals in the Beijer Ref Group, essentially has the effect that the participants will be given an opportunity to acquire, at a market price, call options in respect of class B shares in Beijer Ref AB (publ) (&rdquo;Beijer Ref&rdquo; or <strong>&ldquo;</strong>the Company&rdquo;) that have been repurchased or were already held, and that in connection with the transfer of the call options the participants receive a subsidy in the form of a gross salary supplement corresponding to 50 per cent of the premium paid for the options.</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif">The Scheme consists formally of (A) issuing call options for shares in Beijer Ref, <br /> (B) authorisation of the Board of Directors to decide to acquire the Company&rsquo;s own shares and (C) the transfer of shares repurchased or already held to participants in the incentive Scheme in accordance with the following.</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif">(A) Decision to issue call options for shares in Beijer Ref</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif">The number of call options to be issued shall be no more than 428,000, corresponding to approximately 1.0 per cent of the total number of shares and approximately 0.6 per cent of the total number of votes in the Company (including shares held by the Company). Each call option provides entitlement to the acquisition of one (1) repurchased class B share in the Company during the period from 1 June 2021 until 30 June 2021 inclusive.</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif">The purchase price for shares when exercising the option shall correspond to 120 per cent of the weighted average of the price paid for the Company&rsquo;s share at Nasdaq Stockholm during the period from 25 April 2018 until 2 May 2018 inclusive. The right to acquire call options shall be granted to Executive Management at Beijer Ref and approximately 65 additional key individuals in the Beijer Ref Group who have a direct opportunity to influence the Group&rsquo;s profits. The CEO and other members of Executive Management shall be able to buy no more than 10,000 call options per person. Other participants are divided into two categories according to position, the first group of which with approximately 20 participants shall be able to buy no more than 10,000 call options per person and the second group with approximately 45 participants shall be able to buy no more than 4,000 call options per person. If a person who is entitled to an allocation declines to acquire the call options offered, either fully or partly, such non-acquired call options shall be distributed pro rata between those entitled to an allocation who have registered in writing their interest in acquiring additional call options. In this way, a person who is entitled to an allocation will not be able purchase call options amounting to more than 20 per cent of an annual salary. The Board of Directors shall finally confirm the allocation of call options in accordance with the principles set out in above, as well as the number of call options that will be offered for purchase to employees within each category. Applications to acquire the call options must be submitted by 11 May 2018 at the latest. The premium for the call options shall correspond to the market value of the call options according to an external, independent valuation in accordance with the Black &amp; Scholes model. The call options are freely transferable.</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif">In order to encourage participation in the Scheme, the Board of Directors is authorised to pass a resolution on a subsidy in the form of a gross salary supplement, corresponding to a maximum of 50 per cent of the premium paid for each call option. In this event, payment of the subsidy shall take place in connection with the transfer of the call options.</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif">The Company has a right but not an obligation to repurchase from the participant any call options that the participant does not wish to exercise in accordance with the participant&rsquo;s application to the Company. The repurchase of options shall take place at a price corresponding to the highest market value at any time.</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif">(B) Resolution to authorise the Board of Directors to pass a resolution to acquire the Company&rsquo;s own shares</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif">In order to guarantee Beijer Ref&rsquo;s delivery of shares to the participants in the Scheme, the Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting pass a resolution to authorise the Board of Directors to acquire no more than 341,000 class B shares in the Company before the next Annual General Meeting. Acquisitions shall take place at Nasdaq Stockholm in accordance with the stock exchange&rsquo;s regulations at a price within the price range registered at any time, which means the range between the highest buy rate and the lowest sell rate. Acquisitions shall be paid for in cash and may take place on one or more occasions.</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif">(C) Resolution to transfer shares repurchased or already held to participants in the Scheme</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif">The Board of Directors&rsquo; proposal also means that the Annual General Meeting shall give its approval for the Board of Directors, in a deviation from the preferential rights of shareholders, to transfer to the participants in the Scheme up to 428,000 of the Company&rsquo;s class B shares repurchased and already held at the confirmed redemption price (with reservation for any recalculations). The transfer shall take place during the period when the participants are entitled to exercise the call options to acquire shares in accordance with the terms of the Scheme. The reason for the deviation from the preferential rights of shareholders in connection with the transfer of the Company&rsquo;s own shares is to give Beijer Ref the opportunity to deliver shares in the Company to the participants in the Scheme.</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><em><br /> Dilution, costs and effect on important key indicators</em><em></em></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif">The Scheme does not involve any dilution for existing shareholders as it is based on call options in respect of shares already issued in the Company. The costs of the Scheme consist of the subsidy that may be paid in connection with the transfer of the call options as described above, the social security contributions incurred for this subsidy and the cost of financing the repurchased shares. The total cost for the subsidy is estimated to be approximately SEK 8.0 M (before corporate tax) over the term of the Scheme. Against the subsidy, the option premium corresponds to a total of approximately SEK 12.8 M, which the Company receives for the transfer of the call options. The Company&rsquo;s financing cost for the repurchase of shares is estimated to be approximately SEK 5.6 M before corporate tax. All information is calculated based on a share price of 320 SEK. During its term, the Scheme will have a positive effect on the key indicator profit per share because of the Company&rsquo;s repurchasing of shares and a negative effect because of the costs described above. The net effect on the key indicator &ldquo;profit per share&rdquo; will be insignificant during the term of the Scheme and will disappear entirely after its conclusion. In general terms, it is also determined that the Scheme will have only an insignificant effect on important key indicators.</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><em><br /> Reason for the Scheme and its preparation</em><em></em></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif">The Board of Directors&rsquo; reason for the implementation of the Scheme is to provide executives within the Beijer Ref Group with the opportunity through a personal investment to take part in and strive to achieve a positive value growth in the Company&rsquo;s shares and thereby achieve a greater shared interest between them and the Company&rsquo;s shareholders. The intention of the Scheme is also to contribute to executives in the long term increasing their shareholding in the Company. The Scheme is also expected to create conditions for retaining and recruiting competent personnel in the Beijer Ref Group, to provide competitive compensation and to unite the interests of shareholders and executives. The Board of Directors considers the Scheme to be reasonable in its scope and cost-efficiency. The executives covered by the Scheme are the group that, in an otherwise strongly decentralised organisation, has an opportunity to create a positive impact on profits through collaboration between the Group&rsquo;s subsidiaries. Against this background, the Board of Directors believes that the introduction of the Scheme will have a positive effect on the Beijer Ref Group&rsquo;s continued development and that the Scheme will be of benefit to both the shareholders and the Company. The proposal for the Scheme has been prepared by the Company&rsquo;s Board of Directors. The decision to propose the Scheme to the Annual General Meeting was made by the Board of Directors. Members of the Company&rsquo;s Board of Directors are not covered by the Scheme.</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><em><br /> Majority requirement</em><em></em></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif">The Board of Directors&rsquo; proposal in accordance with points (A)-(C) above shall be adopted as a joint resolution under application of the majority rules in Chapter 16 of the Swedish Companies Act, which means that shareholders with at least nine tenths of both votes submitted and shares represented at the meeting must vote for the resolution.</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>C. MISCELLANEOUS</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>The financial statements, the Auditors&rsquo; statement in accordance with Chapter 8, Para 54 of the <br /> Companies Act, the Board of Director&acute;s remark accordance with Chapter 19 Para 22 of the Companies Act, and the Board of Directors&rsquo; full proposal for resolutions in accordance with the above, will be available on the company&rsquo;s premises from 15 March 2018 and will on request be sent to shareholders stating their address.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>The Board of Directors and the Managing Director shall at the Annual Meeting, if so requested by a shareholder and if the Board of Directors considers it possible without significant harm to the company, provide information about circumstances which can affect the assessment of a matter on the agenda, circumstances which can affect the assessment of the company&rsquo;s or a subsidiary&rsquo;s economic situation and the company&rsquo;s relations to another group company.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>On the date of issue of this Notice, the total number of shares in the company amounts to 42,478,230 shares, representing a total of 72,234,390 votes, divided into 3,306,240 A shares representing 33,062,400 votes and 39,171,990 B shares representing 39,171,990 votes, of which the company holds 87,200 B shares, representing 87,200 votes.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 14pt"><strong>Strongest-ever fourth quarter</strong></span></p><p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif">Net sales for the fourth quarter of 2017 increased by 9 per cent compared with the corresponding period in the previous year and amounted to SEK 2,401M (2 199).</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif">Operating profit for the fourth quarter of 2017 amounted to SEK 179M (145). It is an improvement of 24 per cent compared with the same period last year.</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif">Profit for the quarter amounted to SEK 146M (100).</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif">Profit per share amounted to SEK 3.39 (2.29).</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif">The acquisition of Tecsa (Pty) Ltd has now been approved by the competition authority in South Africa and the planned takeover date is expected to be 1 March 2018.</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif">The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual Meeting of shareholders resolves that an increased dividend of SEK 5.75 (5.50) per share shall be paid.</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Comments by the CEO</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><span>Strong end to the year brings record profit.</span></strong></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Beijer Ref ends 2017 with its strongest year and strongest fourth quarter so far. Net sales for the full year increased by 8.7 percent and reached almost SEK 10 billion, while we also achieved improved margins and a strong operating profit. Organic growth for the quarter was almost 11 percent. Earnings per share for the year exceeded SEK 12, which is a record for us. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><span>WE DEVELOP THE TECHNOLOGY OF THE FUTURE</span></strong><span> </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>A couple of factors stand out in the year and the quarter, both of which have a positive impact on the Group&rsquo;s profit. The regulatory phasing-out of HFC refrigerants is one of them. The Climate Agreement signed in Paris in 2015 states that more than half of the HFC gases in EU Member States shall be phased out by 2020.Although it is our assessment that most countries will not be able to keep to that schedule, an intensive phase is expected in which many companies will need to upgrade their technology at the same time. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Beijer Ref is well-equipped to meet the market&rsquo;s needs during the transition and can provide the market with alternatives to both maintain existing technology and upgrade to new technology. Above all, we are working actively to provide customers with green technology that is developed and manufactured within our OEM activities. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>The economic upturn with low interest rates and high consumption has also contributed to the increase in the Group&rsquo;s sales. Virtually all of Beijer Ref&rsquo;s regions report growth compared with the fourth quarter last year. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><span>PERFORMANCE IN THE REGIONS</span></strong><span> </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Southern Europe, which is our biggest single region, grew by 16 percent. Activities in France had a strong quarter, with the HVAC segment accounting for most of the growth in sales. We have also been working to identify smarter solutions for logistics and purchasing. This is now starting to have an impact on the profit. The acquisition of the Toshiba distributor DX Por in Portugal has given us another market to operate in and has already made a positive contribution to our sales in Southern Europe.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>The Central Europe region grew by 13 percent during the quarter. Our companies in the UK and Ireland continue to report improved profits, partly because of sales of refrigerants, which are gradually becoming more expensive because of the quota system. At the end of the year we opened a large new logistics centre in the Southern Netherlands, which will hold stocks of products and articles for the whole region, resulting in both cost savings and more efficient delivery flows in the years ahead.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Growth in the Nordic region grew by 3 percent. The off-shore business in Norway is still experiencing an economic downturn, bringing down the growth figure for the region, while the businesses in Sweden, Denmark and Finland have performed well. The transition to new environmental technology is part of the reason for increased sales. The trend indicates that demand for natural refrigerants will continue to rise even more quickly in 2018.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>The Eastern Europe region grew strongly, by 27 percent. Here too, we see a general increase in consumption, leading to higher demand for environmental technology and comfort cooling. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Asia Pacific reports stable growth. Our own green air conditioning system, CUBO2 Smart, was recently installed for the first time in Australia. This is a good indication that our OEM activities have good prospects for growth there as well. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Africa is the only one of our regions not reporting growth. Consumption in general is being held back by the economic recession in South Africa. We still believe that Africa is an extremely interesting market for Beijer Ref. An expanding middle class will want to invest in comfort cooling again once the temporary downturn in the market has passed. It is therefore pleasing that the competition authority in South Africa has now announced that they have approved our acquisition of the air conditioning wholesaler TecsaReco. Formal approval is still being awaited from the competition authorities in Namibia and Botswana. But as they represent less than five percent of Tesca&rsquo;s business, any possible impact will be marginal for us. We are preparing the takeover of the company, which is expected to be incorporated into our accounts as of 1 March this year.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><span>A BIGGER BEIJER REF IS THE FUTURE SCENARIO</span></strong></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>We have a generally positive view of the future, with markets growing rapidly and continuing to demand our products more and more. We analyse acquisitions continuously and would like to add more companies that can supplement and enhance our presence in expansive markets. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>In summary, 2017 was a record-breaking year for Beijer Ref, with both net sales and profit exceeding the previous year&rsquo;s figures. Beijer Ref&rsquo;s Board of Directors proposes an increased dividend of SEK 5.75 kronor (5.50), which reflects our strong year and good market prospects. We are well prepared to face 2018.</span></p>

<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Fourth quarter of 2017</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><span>NET SALES</span></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Beijer Ref increased its net sales by 9.1 percent to SEK 2,401 million (2,199) in the fourth quarter of 2017. A favourable economic situation has resulted in continued strong growth in demand in our key European markets. Virtually all regions report growth in net sales during the fourth quarter. Adjusted for exchange rate changes and acquisitions, organic growth in net sales was 10.7 percent. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Net sales during the year increased by 8.7 percent to SEK 9,830 million (9,045). Adjusted for exchange rate changes and acquisitions, organic growth in net sales was 5.2 percent.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><span>PROFIT</span></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>The Group&rsquo;s operating profit totalled SEK 179 million (145) during the fourth quarter, an increase of 23.5 percent. The phasing-out of refrigerants has resulted in dramatic price rises in refrigerants with a high GWP value, which has had a positive impact on the profit in the period. Adjusted for exchange rate changes and acquisitions, the organic improvement in the operating profit was 25.6 percent. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>The operating profit increased during the year by 22.3 percent to SEK 725 million (593). Adjusted for exchange rate changes and acquisitions, the organic increase in the operating profit was 19.4 percent. Group net financial items during the year totalled SEK -26 million (-33). The pre-tax profit was SEK 699 million (560). The profit for the year was SEK 521 million (399). </span><span>Earnings per share totalled SEK 12.06 (9.17).</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><span>CASH FLOW</span></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Cash flow from operating activities before change in working capital was SEK 635 million for the 12 months of 2017, compared with SEK 478 million during the corresponding period of the previous year. During 12 months, the working capital increased by SEK 135 million against an increase of SEK 413 million during the same period of the previous year. This results in cash flow from operating activities of SEK 500 million, compared with SEK 65 million in the previous year. The improved profit and greater focus on operating capital have contributed to an improved cash flow.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><span>INVESTMENTS</span></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Group investments in fixed assets amounted to SEK 99 million (80) for the year.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><span>DIVIDEND</span></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual Meeting of shareholders resolves that a dividend of SEK 5.75 (5.50) per share shall be paid for the 2017 financial year. This is equivalent to a total of SEK 243.7M if the shares currently held by the company are excluded.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><span>SIGNIFICANT EVENTS DURING THE YEAR</span></strong><span> </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>As part of Beijer Ref&rsquo;s objective to be at the cutting edge of the transition to environmentally friendly refrigeration technology, the first environmentally friendly, carbon dioxide-based refrigeration system was delivered to Chile at the beginning of the year. This was the Group&rsquo;s first supply in South America and is in line with Beijer Ref&rsquo;s focus on carbon dioxide and other environmentally friendly refrigeration technology to contribute to lower impact on the greenhouse effect.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>During the second quarter, Maria Ryd&eacute;n was appointed as the new CFO and member of the Group management team. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>The assets of the Portuguese HVAC distribution company DX Por, which has its head office in Porto, were acquired in September. The company is a main distributor for Toshiba HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, Air Conditioning) in Portugal. DX Por is being integrated in Beijer Ref&rsquo;s organisation and is included in the consolidated accounts from September 2017.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>The refrigerants HCFC and HFC are being actively phased out in China. The German retail chain Metro AG has therefore selected Beijer Ref&rsquo;s Italian subsidiary SCM Frigo to supply the chain&rsquo;s first transcritical CO2 refrigeration system in China. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>In October, Beijer Ref AB signed a contract to acquire Tecsa (Pty) Ltd and its assets. Tecsa (Pty) Ltd, owned by Westbrooke Investment and operating under the brand TecsaReco, is a wholesaler based in South Africa which offers a wide range of products and brands for commercial and comfort refrigeration and air conditioning and spare parts for white goods. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>The parties have signed a binding contract, and the takeover is planned for 1 March 2018. The acquisition is estimated to have a long-term positive impact on both sales and profit. The competition authority in South Africa (CompCom SA) has examined the transaction and given its final approval. This confirms that the acquisition will not affect the competition situation in the South African air conditioning wholesale market. It is conditional upon the disposal of two branches in Polokwane and Rustenburg in South Africa. The competition authorities in Botswana and Namibia are expected to respond with their announcements shortly.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><span>RISK DESCRIPTION</span></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>The Beijer Ref Group&rsquo;s operations are subject to a number of business environment factors, the effects of which on the Group&rsquo;s operating profit can be controlled to varying degrees. The Group&rsquo;s operations depend on general economic trends, primarily in Europe, which determine demand for Beijer Ref&rsquo;s products and services. Acquisitions are normally associated with risks, for example staff departures. Other operating risks, such as agency and supplier agreements, product liability and delivery commitments, technical development, warranties, dependence on key individuals, etc., are analysed continually. Where necessary, measures are taken to reduce the Group&rsquo;s risk exposure. In its operations, Beijer Ref is subject to financial risks such as currency risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk. The Parent&rsquo;s risk profile is the same as that of the Group. For further information, see the Group&rsquo;s Annual Report.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><span>ACCOUNTING POLICIES</span></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>This interim report was prepared in accordance with IAS 34, the Swedish Annual Accounts Act and the Swedish Financial Reporting Board&rsquo;s recommendation RFR 2 &lsquo;Accounting for legal entities&rsquo;. Beijer Ref continues to apply the same accounting policies and valuation methods as those described in the most recent annual report, except as specified in the following. New and amended standards applied as from 1 January 2017 are not expected to have any material effect on the Group&rsquo;s or Parent&rsquo;s profit or financial position. For more information on future standards that have not yet entered into force, see page 43 of the 2016 Annual Report.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><span>ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN 2018</span></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>A number of new and amended standards are effective for periods beginning after January 1, 2018. The company has analyzed the consequences of the accounting standards &ldquo;IFRS 9 Financial Instruments&rdquo; and &ldquo;IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers&rdquo;. None of these is expected to have a significant effect on the consolidated financial statements of the Group or the Parent company. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>This interim report for Beijer Ref AB (publ) has been submitted following approval by the Board of Directors.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 14pt"><strong>Rising demand means a strong quarter</strong></span></p><p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif">Net sales in the third quarter of 2017 increased by 4 percent compared with the same period last year, amounting to SEK 2,555 million (2,461).</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif">The operating profit for the third quarter of 2017 was SEK 217 million (173). This is an increase of 25 percent on the same period last year.</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif">The profit for the period was SEK 149 million (117), an increase of 28 percent on the same period last year.</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif">Earnings per share amounted to SEK 3.47 (2.71).</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif">Acquisition of DX Portugal.</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif">Since the end of the reporting period, a contract has been signed to acquire the South African company Tecsa.</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Comments by the CEO</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Rising demand means a strong quarter</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>We have ended another strong quarter. A warm summer in Southern Europe helped increase the need for air conditioning even further, and some of our biggest markets had double-digit growth. Our strong, established brands are well positioned to meet increased demand.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>The phase-out of refrigerants with a negative climate impact is continuing. Import restrictions are also causing rising prices for these refrigerants, which had a positive impact on the Group&rsquo;s profit. In parallel, demand for greener alternatives is growing. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Investment in our own production of green refrigeration systems is continuing. Organic growth for our OEM activities is almost 6 percent. Demand is high not only in Europe. During the quarter, the green light was given for Beijer Ref to supply the first transcritical CO2 refrigeration system to the retail giant Metro in China. This paves the way for considerably more orders on this huge market. Our CUBO2 Smart refrigeration system, one of the greenest products on the market for small stores, has also been well received in several European countries. It is being launched in Australia in the next quarter. This is a good indicator that we are helping drive the development of the industry in a more environmentally friendly direction.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>The warm summer was most obvious in Southern and Central Europe. Consequently, France, our biggest, most important market, which also benefited from a strong economy, reported organic growth of 9 percent. Central Europe reported growth of 7 percent, with the UK accounting for a double-digit increase of approximately 16 percent. The increasing pace of the phase-out of refrigerants with a high GWP value is largely behind this growth. Our sales are increasing by 3 percent in the Nordic region and 5 percent in Eastern Europe. There is also stable development in Asia Pacific, with growth of 5 percent. Sales of air conditioning units are high, and the restructuring of operations in Australia is now having a positive impact on profit. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Africa continued to develop slowly, primarily on account of the weak economic situation. However, the potential of this market remains very high. Consequently, it is extremely gratifying that in mid-October we signed a contract for the biggest acquisition of the year so far, of Tecsa in South Africa. We are now building a solid base on a big market that is adjudged to have considerable growth potential as the population&rsquo;s standard of living gradually improves.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Another important acquisition is the Portuguese company DX Por. This means yet another country for our map of Toshiba distributors, and it will gradually produce higher market shares in Portugal.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>We take a generally very positive view of the future, with markets that are developing fast and rising demand for our products. We have our cost base well under control and are extremely well placed to enter the fourth quarter.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Per Bertland</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Third quarter 2017</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Sales</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Beijer Ref increased its sales by 3.8 percent to SEK 2,555 million (2,461) during the third quarter of 2017. The increase in sales is due to continued strong growth in demand on our European key markets. Adjusted for exchange rate fluctuations and acquisitions, there was a 4.6 percent organic increase in sales. During the first three quarters of the year, sales increased by 8.5 percent to SEK 7,429 million (6,845). Adjusted for exchange rate fluctuations and acquisitions, there was a 3.5 percent organic increase in sales.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Profit</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Group operating profit amounted to SEK 217 million (173) during the third quarter, an increase of 25.4 percent. A warm summer, primarily in southern Europe, resulted in increased demand for air conditioning, and this had a positive impact on the profit for the period. Dramatic price rises for refrigerants with a high GWP value also had a positive impact on profit. Adjusted for exchange rate fluctuations and acquisitions, there was a 26.0 percent organic increase in operating profit. During the first three quarters of the year, operating profit increased by 21.9 percent to SEK 546 million (448). Adjusted for exchange rate fluctuations and acquisitions, there was a 17.5 percent organic increase in operating profit. During the first nine months of the year, Group net financial items amounted to SEK -22 million (-25). Pre-tax profit was SEK 525 million (423). The profit for the period was SEK 375 million (299). Earnings per share amounted to SEK 8.67 (6.88).</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Cash flow</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Cash flow from operating activities before change in working capital was SEK 500 million during the first nine months of 2017, compared with SEK 381 million during the corresponding period of the previous year. During the first nine months of the year, the working capital increased by SEK 130 million against an increase of SEK 352 million during the same period of the previous year. This results in cash flow from operating activities of SEK 366 million, compared with SEK 29 million in the previous year. Working capital at the beginning of 2017 was higher than at the beginning of 2016, which meant higher cash flow than during the corresponding period of the previous year.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Investments</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Group investments in fixed assets amounted to SEK 72 million (61) in the first nine months of the year.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Significant events during the year</span><span> </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>As part of Beijer Ref&rsquo;s objective to be at the cutting edge of the transition to environmentally friendly refrigeration technology, the first environmentally friendly, carbon dioxide-based refrigeration system was delivered to Chile at the beginning of the year. This was the Group&rsquo;s first supply in South America and is in line with Beijer Ref&rsquo;s focus on carbon dioxide and other environmentally friendly refrigeration technology to contribute to lower impact on the greenhouse effect.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>During the second quarter, Maria Ryd&eacute;n was appointed as the new CFO and member of the Group management team. Her most recent position was as CEO of Ikano V&aring;rdboende and she was previously CFO of Ikano Fastigheter, Dole and Switchcore. Maria Ryd&eacute;n will take up her position on 1 November 2017.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>The assets of the Portuguese HVAC distribution company DX Por, which has its head office in Porto, were acquired in September. DX Por was founded in 2005 and has annual sales of approximately SEK 40 million. The company is a main distributor for Toshiba HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, Air Conditioning) in Portugal. The Portuguese HVAC market, which has gradually recovered since the crisis in 2008, is estimated to be worth almost SEK 900 million. DX Por is being integrated in Beijer Ref&rsquo;s organisation and is included in the consolidated accounts from September 2017.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>The refrigerants HCFC and HFC are being actively phased out in China. The German retail chain Metro AG has therefore selected Beijer Ref&rsquo;s subsidiary SCM Frigo to supply the chain&rsquo;s first transcritical CO2 refrigeration system. The technology will be installed in Metro&rsquo;s wholesale store in Beijing later in the year. This will be a major milestone in the carbon dioxide emissions field in China. Metro AG previously communicated its target to reduce the use of F-gases in stores worldwide by 95 percent by 2030.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Events after the reporting period</span><span> </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>In October, Beijer Ref AB signed a contract to acquire Tecsa (Pty) Ltd and its assets. Tecsa (Pty) Ltd, owned by Westbrooke Investment and operating under the brand TecsaReco, is a wholesaler based in South Africa which offers a wide range of products and brands for commercial and comfort refrigeration and air conditioning and spare parts for white goods. Tecsa was founded in 1965 as a wholesaler of parts and accessories for household appliances. In 2013, Tecsa acquired Reco, a refrigeration and air conditioning wholesaler that began operating in 1947. The company&rsquo;s head office is in Johannesburg and sales are via a number of branches, one of which is in Namibia and another in Botswana. The parties have signed a binding contract, and the takeover is planned for 1 March 2018. The acquisition is estimated to have a long-term positive impact on both sales and profit. The acquisition is subject to approval by the competition authorities in South Africa, Namibia and Botswana.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Risk description</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>The Beijer Ref Group&rsquo;s operations are subject to a number of business environment factors, the effects of which on the Group&rsquo;s operating profit can be controlled to varying degrees. The Group&rsquo;s operations depend on general economic trends, primarily in Europe, which determine demand for Beijer Ref&rsquo;s products and services. Acquisitions are normally associated with risks, for example staff departures. Other operating risks, such as agency and supplier agreements, product liability and delivery commitments, technical development, warranties, dependence on key individuals, etc., are analysed continually. Where necessary, measures are taken to reduce the Group&rsquo;s risk exposure. In its operations, Beijer Ref is subject to financial risks such as currency risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk. The Parent&rsquo;s risk profile is the same as that of the Group. For further information, see the Group&rsquo;s Annual Report.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>This interim report for Beijer Ref AB (publ) has been submitted following approval by the Board of Directors.</span></p>

<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Accounting policies</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>This interim report was prepared in accordance with IAS 34, the Swedish Annual Accounts Act and the Swedish Financial Reporting Board&rsquo;s recommendation RFR 2 &lsquo;Accounting for legal entities&rsquo;. Beijer Ref continues to apply the same accounting policies and valuation methods as those described in the most recent annual report, except as specified in the following.

<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Introduction</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>We have reviewed the condensed interim financial information (interim report) of Beijer Ref AB (publ) as of 30 September 2017 and the nine-month period then ended. The board of directors and the CEO are responsible for the preparation and presentation of the interim financial information in accordance with IAS 34 and the Swedish Annual Accounts Act. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on this interim report based on our review.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Scope of Review</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>We conducted our review in accordance with the International Standard on Review Engagements ISRE 2410, Review of Interim Report Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity.&nbsp; A review consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing, ISA, and other generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden. The procedures performed in a review do not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit.&nbsp; Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Conclusion</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the interim report is not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with IAS 34 and the Swedish Annual Accounts Act, regarding the Group, and with the Swedish Annual Accounts Act, regarding the Parent Company.</span></p>

<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Beijer Ref in short</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>The Beijer Ref Group is focused on trading and distribution operations within refrigeration products, air conditioning and heat pumps. The product programme consists mainly of agency products from leading international manufacturers and, in addition, some manufacture of own products, combined with service and support for the products. The Group creates added value by contributing: technical competence to the products; accounting for knowledge and experience about the market; and by providing efficient logistics and warehousing.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Operations are carried out by region within the Beijer Ref, which comprises Beijer Ref ARW (Air conditioning, refrigeration, wholesale) and Toshiba&rsquo;s distribution operation within air conditioning and heating. The Beijer Ref Group is a leading operator within the refrigeration sector in Europe and has a significant position within air conditioning in Europe. The operation is split into six geographic segments: Nordic countries, Southern Europe, Central Europe, Eastern Europe, Africa and Asia Pacific. Growth is achieved both organically and through the acquisition of companies which supplement existing operations.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Seasonal effects</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Beijer Ref&rsquo;s sales are seasonally dependent as demand for refrigeration and air conditioning is at its peak during the warm months of the year. It means that demand in the northern hemisphere is at its peak during the second and third quarters whilst demand in the southern hemisphere is at its peak during the first and fourth quarters. </span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><strong><strong>Beijer Ref AB has entered into an agreement to acquire the business of Tecsa (Pty) Ltd and its assets. The acquisition broadens the base in Southern Africa.</strong></strong></span></p><p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif">Tecsa Pty Ltd, controlled by Westbrooke Investments and trading as TecsaReco, is a South African wholesaler that offers a wide range of products and brands within commercial and domestic refrigeration, air conditioning and spare parts for domestic appliances. Beijer Ref acquires the company for a purchase price amounting to between SEK 255 and 300 million. The variable portion of the purchase price is dependent on TecsaReco&rsquo;s performance in the current financial year ending 28 February 2018.</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif">Tecsa was originally founded in 1965 as a wholesaler of parts and accessories for household appliances. In 2013, Tecsa acquired Reco, a refrigeration and air conditioning wholesaler that started its operations in 1947.</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif">The company&rsquo;s headquarters are located in Johannesburg and its products are distributed through a number of branches, of which one is located in Namibia and one in Botswana. In total, TecsaReco has more than 300 employees and gross sales in 2016 amounted to approximately SEK 435 million. The company has a good track record and is profitable. The business will continue to be operated as a standalone business in its current form.</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif">Beijer Ref is previously present in South Africa through the wholly owned refrigeration wholesalers Eurocool and Metraclark.</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif">&rdquo;The acquisition is positive for several reasons,&rdquo; said Per Bertland, CEO of Beijer Ref. &rdquo;Our product range is strengthened with complementary segments and brands. We also access new and well-established sales channels. Above all, Beijer Ref acquires a stronger footprint in a growing market with a population that is gradually increasing its income and purchasing ability. The opportunities to reach out with our own manufactured and more environmentally friendly products also increase significantly.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif">The parties have reached a binding agreement as of today and the takeover is scheduled for 1 March 2018. The acquisition is expected to generate positive effects on both sales and results in the long term. The purchase is subject to approval by the competition authorities in South Africa, Namibia and Botswana.<em>&nbsp;</em></p>

The installation sets a huge milestone in the area of CO2emissions in China.</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif">&ldquo;A successful installation could expand the market in China rapidly as it will lead to more foreign companies feeling confident to use CO2as a refrigerant,&rdquo; said Per Bertland, CEO of Beijer Ref.</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif">Metro AG has previously communicated its aim to phase out F-gases in stores worldwide by 95% by 2030.</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif">&ldquo;We are proud to be selected as partner to Metro &ndash; a retail chain with significant size and influence on the market &ndash; in its strive implement eco-friendly refrigerants.

<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>&ldquo;The acquisition complements our footprint in the Iberian Peninsula with an entity in Portugal and will strengthen the distribution of Toshiba air-conditioning systems in this country.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 14pt"><strong>The strongest quarter to date</strong></span></p><p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif">Net sales in the second quarter of 2017 increased by 10 percent compared with the same period last year, amounting to SEK 2,657 million (2,417). The increase is due to strong growth in demand on several of our key markets and positive currency effects.</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif">The OEM and Comfort Cooling product segments continued the year strong, while Commercial Cooling remains stable.</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif">The operating profit for the second quarter of 2017 was SEK 223 million (186). This is an increase of 20 percent on the same period last year.</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif">The profit for the period was SEK 154 million (121), an increase of 27 percent on the same period last year.</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif">Earnings per share amounted to SEK 3.56 (2.82).</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Comments by the CEO</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Our strongest quarter to date</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Despite a slightly weak start to April, the second quarter of 2017 ended up being the strongest quarter in Beijer Ref&rsquo;s history. We had double-digit growth in both sales and profit and saw growth in both geographical segments and our product segments. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>The warm spring on the major markets in Southern Europe and increased focus on air conditioning are two of the reasons for the good growth. Another important factor is that HFCs, the refrigerants which have a negative climate impact, have dramatically increased in price as a result of import restrictions. The recently initiated phasing-out of HFC refrigerants means a faster switchover to greener alternatives, both natural and synthetic. A step in the right direction. Europe is leading developments and, as many non-European countries are following suit, we expect a corresponding increase in demand on these markets as well. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>We therefore continue to develop our own solutions and have presented CUBO2 Smart during the year. This is an environmentally friendly cooling unit for installation in small stores, petrol stations and other small premises. Our own-developed heat pump TripleAqua also attracted attention during the quarter, winning several innovation prizes. It uses the natural refrigerant propane. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>We enjoyed strong, double-digit growth for our two product segments OEM and HVAC. The growth in the Commercial Cooling product segment was also positive but at a slower rate. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><span>Positive on many markets</span></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>In France, which is our biggest market, we enjoyed strong growth during the quarter. One factor was the warm weather, which boosted sales of air conditioning units. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>There has also been excellent growth in the Netherlands and the UK/Ireland. In the UK/Ireland we have seen major commercial effects of our integration work after the acquisition of HRP. Our concentration on factors such as back office and logistics has produced good results in terms of costs, while we are also seeing sales growth.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Asia Pacific is another region with stable growth and an organic increase in profit. Our work to restructure operations in Australia has begun to have an impact on costs. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>In Africa, we had weak growth for the second quarter in a row. We estimate that this is a temporary decline and retain our confidence in the African market. We are planning to expand and supplied our first transcritical CO2 solution to South Africa in the quarter. We estimate that there are good opportunities to expand sales of environmentally friendly CO2 solutions on the African market as well in the long term. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>The good growth on most of our key markets, combined with increasing demand for green solutions, means that we begin the third quarter with confidence.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Per Bertland</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Second quarter 2017</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Sales</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Beijer Ref increased net sales by 9.9 percent to SEK 2,657 million (2,417) during the second quarter of 2017. The increase in sales is due to strong growth in demand on our European key markets and positive currency effects. Adjusted for exchange rate fluctuations and acquisitions, there was a 2.5 percent organic change in sales.&nbsp; During the first half of the year, net sales increased by 11.2 percent to SEK 4,874 million (4,384). Adjusted for exchange rate fluctuations and acquisitions, there was a 2.9 percent organic change in sales.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Profit</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Group operating profit amounted to SEK 223 million (186) during the second quarter, an increase of 19.6 percent. The growth in profit is due to the warm spring having contributed to increased demand for air conditioning, primarily in Southern Europe and there have been price rises for refrigerants with a severe negative impact on global warming. Cost savings as a result of increased coordination in administration and logistics also contributed to the higher profit. Adjusted for exchange rate fluctuations and acquisitions, there was a 13.7 percent organic increase in operating profit. During the first half of the year, the operating profit increased by 19.7 percent to SEK 330 million (275). Adjusted for exchange rate fluctuations and acquisitions, there was a 12.6 percent organic increase in operating profit. During the first half of the year, Group net financial items amounted to SEK -14 million (-15). Pre-tax profit was SEK 316 million (260). The profit for the period was SEK 226 million (182). Earnings per share amounted to SEK 5.20 (4.17).</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Cash flow</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Cash flow from operating activities before change in working capital was SEK 308 million during the first half of 2017, compared with SEK 230 million during the corresponding period of the previous year. During the first half of the year, the working capital increased by SEK 247 million against an increase of SEK 340 million during the same period of the previous year. This results in cash flow from operating activities of SEK 60 million, compared with SEK -110 million in the previous year. Working capital at the beginning of 2017 was higher than at the beginning of 2016, which meant higher cash flow than during the corresponding period of the previous year.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Investments</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Group investments in non-current assets amounted to SEK 50 million (50) in the first six months.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Significant events during the year</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>As part of Beijer Ref&rsquo;s objective to be at the cutting edge of the transition to environmentally friendly cooling technology, the first environmentally friendly, carbon dioxide-based cooling system was delivered to Chile at the beginning of the year. This was the Group&rsquo;s first installation in South America and is in line with Beijer Ref&rsquo;s focus on carbon dioxide and other environmentally friendly cooling technology to contribute to lower impact on the greenhouse effect. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>During the second quarter, Maria Ryd&eacute;n was appointed as the new CFO and member of the Group management team. Her most recent position was as CEO of Ikano V&aring;rdboende and she was previously CFO of Ikano Fastigheter, Dole and Switchcore. Maria Ryd&eacute;n will take up her position no later than 1 December 2017.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Risk description</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>The Beijer Ref Group&rsquo;s operations are subject to a number of business environment factors, the effects of which on the Group&rsquo;s operating profit can be controlled to varying degrees. The Group&rsquo;s operations depend on general economic trends, primarily in Europe, which determine demand for Beijer Ref&rsquo;s products and services. Acquisitions are normally associated with risks, for example staff departures. Other operating risks, such as agency and supplier agreements, product liability and delivery commitments, technical development, warranties, dependence on key individuals, etc., are analysed continually. Where necessary, measures are taken to reduce the Group&rsquo;s risk exposure. In its operations, Beijer Ref is subject to financial risks such as currency risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk. The Parent&rsquo;s risk profile is the same as that of the Group. For further information, see the Group&rsquo;s Annual Report.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Accounting policies</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>This interim report was prepared in accordance with IAS 34, the Swedish Annual Accounts Act and the Swedish Financial Reporting Board&rsquo;s recommendation RFR 2 &lsquo;Accounting for legal entities&rsquo;. Beijer Ref continues to apply the same accounting policies and valuation methods as those described in the most recent annual report, except as specified in the following. New and amended standards applied as from 1 January 2017 are not expected to have any material effect on the Group&rsquo;s or Parent&rsquo;s profit or financial position.</span></p>

<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Beijer Ref in short</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>The Beijer Ref Group is focused on trading and distribution operations within refrigeration products, air conditioning and heat pumps. The product programme consists mainly of agency products from leading international manufacturers and, in addition, some manufacture of own products, combined with service and support for the products. The Group creates added value by contributing: technical competence to the products; accounting for knowledge and experience about the market; and by providing efficient logistics and warehousing.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Operations are carried out by region within the Beijer Ref, which comprises Beijer Ref ARW (Air conditioning, refrigeration, wholesale) and Toshiba&rsquo;s distribution operation within air conditioning and heating. The Beijer Ref Group is a leading operator within the refrigeration sector in Europe and has a significant position within air conditioning in Europe. The operation is split into six geographic segments: Nordic countries, Southern Europe, Central Europe, Eastern Europe, Africa and Asia Pacific. Growth is achieved both organically and through the acquisition of companies which supplement existing operations.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Seasonal effects</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Beijer Ref&rsquo;s sales are seasonally dependent as demand for refrigeration and air conditioning is at its peak during the warm months of the year. It means that demand in the northern hemisphere is at its peak during the second and third quarters whilst demand in the southern hemisphere is at its peak during the first and fourth quarters. </span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 14pt"><strong>A good start to the year</strong></span></p><p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif">Net sales in the first quarter of 2017 increased by 13 percent compared with the same period last year, amounting to SEK 2,218 million (1,967). The increase is due to acquisitions and good growth on the European markets.</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif">The OEM and Comfort Cooling market areas have enjoyed a strong start to the year. The Commercial Cooling market area is stable.</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif">The operating profit for the first quarter of 2017 was SEK 107 million (89). This is an increase of 20 percent compared to the same period last year.</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif">The profit for the period was SEK 72 million (61), an increase of 18 percent compared to the same period last year.</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif">Earnings per share amounted to SEK 1.63 (1.35).</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Comments by the CEO</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>A good start to the year</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Both sales and operating profit shows a double-digit increase in the first quarter. Although there is uncertainty in market, partly on account of the Presidential elections in France and the Brexit negotiations, we can see generally good growth both macroeconomically and in our own sector. The Purchasing Managers&rsquo; Index (PMI) is strong on all our major markets, and the ongoing transition to more environmentally friendly refrigerants is providing good business opportunities with both new and existing customers. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><span>Strong in Europe</span></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Organic growth for the quarter was just over 3%. On the European markets, growth was healthy, and we expect continued positive growth there in the coming quarter. Demand for environmentally friendly carbon dioxide-based solutions continues to increase. This is the result of the EU decision to phase out refrigerants with a high impact on the greenhouse effect. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; The summer in South Africa was unusually wet and cold. Sales of air-conditioning equipment are weather-dependent and did not meet our expectations in South Africa on account of the poor weather. The Asia Pacific region is on a par with last year. A decision was recently made in Australia to begin phasing out older refrigerants in 2018, which is expected to have long-term positive market effects.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; The delivery of the first environmentally friendly carbon dioxide-based cooling system to Chile was a milestone during the quarter. The order was performed by our subsidiary SCM Frigo and is the Group&rsquo;s first installation in South America. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><span>Strong growth for OEM and Comfort Cooling</span></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>The growth in the OEM and Comfort Cooling market areas is continuing. During the first quarter, sales in Comfort Cooling increased by 20% (of which 10% organic growth). </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; For the OEM market area, growth was 22% (of which 17% organic growth), and we consider that OEM manufacture has further potential. In recent years, we have seen increased demand for customised, environmentally friendly solutions for large installations, for example large supermarkets. The focus on the OEM range is being enhanced in 2017, partly by expanding the product portfolio with environmentally friendly solutions for small and medium-sized stores.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><span>Work on digitalisation continues</span></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Our new organisation is in place, with country managers for all major markets. This gives us a better opportunity to coordinate purchasing, logistics and marketing. On several markets, we are working with a number of separate brands in stores to allow us to adapt our offering in the best possible way to different customer segments and regions.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; We are continuing to digitalise our operations and expect to launch our first Group-wide e-commerce solution during the year. This will offer customers new ways of placing orders and may help us reach new customer groups. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; Parallel to this, we are continuing to free up capital by reviewing stocks and credit periods. During the year, we will also intensify our sustainability work and create support systems and procedures for the organisation.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp; We are accelerating our work on acquisitions and hope to be able to present new ones during the year. The above factors, combined with favourable macroeconomic conditions, mean that we are optimistic about 2017.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Per Bertland</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>First quarter 2017</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Sales</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Beijer Ref increased net sales by 12.7 percent to SEK 2,218 million (1,967) during the first quarter of 2017. The increase in sales comes primarily from the acquired company HRP. Adjusted for exchange rate fluctuations and acquisitions, there was a 3.1 percent increase in organic sales. The increase in organic sales is explained primarily by improvement on the majority of the European markets.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Profit</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Group operating profit amounted to SEK 107 million (89) during the first quarter, an increase of 20.3 percent. The increase in profit is a result of the good growth on the European markets. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>The operating margin for the quarter is slightly higher than the same period last year at 4.8 percent (4.5 percent).</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Adjusted for exchange rate fluctuations and acquisitions, there was a 10.2 percent organic increase in operating profit during the quarter. During the first quarter, Group net financial items amounted to SEK -7 million (-4). Profit before tax was SEK 100 million (85). Net profit for the period was SEK 72 million (61). Earnings per share amounted to SEK 1.63 (1.35).</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Cash flow</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Cash flow from operating activities before change in working capital was SEK 95 million during the first quarter of 2017, compared with SEK 87 million during the corresponding period of the previous year. During the first quarter, the working capital decreased by SEK 88 million, compared with an increase of SEK 95 million during the corresponding period of the previous year. This results in cash flow from operating activities of SEK 183 million, compared with SEK -8 million in the previous year. Working capital at the beginning of 2017 were higher than at the beginning of 2016, which meant lower capital requirements than during the corresponding period of the previous year.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Investments</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Group investments in non-current assets amounted to SEK 21 million (21) in the first quarter.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Significant events during the year</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>As part of Beijer Ref&rsquo;s objective to be at the cutting edge of the transition to environ&shy;mentally friendly cooling technology, the first environmentally friendly, carbon dioxide-based cooling system was delivered to Chile during the quarter. This was the Group&rsquo;s first installation in South America and is in line with Beijer Ref&rsquo;s focus on carbon dioxide and other environmentally friendly cooling technology to contribute to lower impact on the greenhouse effect. </span>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Risk description</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>The Beijer Ref Group&rsquo;s operations are subject to a number of business environment factors, the effects of which on the Group&rsquo;s operating profit can be controlled to varying degrees. The Group&rsquo;s operations depend on general economic trends, primarily in Europe, which determine demand for Beijer Ref&rsquo;s products and services. Acquisitions are normally associated with risks, for example staff departures. Other operating risks, such as agency and supplier agreements, product liability and delivery commitments, technical development, warranties, dependence on key individuals, etc., are analysed continually. Where necessary, measures are taken to reduce the Group&rsquo;s risk exposure. In its operations, Beijer Ref is subject to financial risks such as currency risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk. The Parent&rsquo;s risk profile is the same as that of the Group. For further information, see the Group&rsquo;s Annual Report.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Malm&ouml;, 24 April 2017</span></p>

<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>This interim report has not been reviewed by the Company&rsquo;s auditors.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><em><span>This information is information that Beijer Ref AB is obliged to make public pursuant to the EU Market Abuse Regulation and the Securities Markets Act. The information was submitted for publication, through the agency of the contact person set out above, at 08.30 CET on 24 April 2017.</span></em></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Accounting policies</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>This interim report was prepared in accordance with IAS 34, the Swedish Annual Accounts Act and the Swedish Financial Reporting Board&rsquo;s recommendation RFR 2 &lsquo;Accounting for legal entities&rsquo;. Beijer Ref continues to apply the same accounting policies and valuation methods as those described in the most recent annual report, except as specified in the following. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>New and amended standards applied as from 1 January 2017 are not expected to have any material effect on the Group&rsquo;s or Parent&rsquo;s profit or financial position.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Beijer Ref in short</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>The Beijer Ref Group is focused on trading and distribution operations within refrigeration products, air conditioning and heat pumps. The product programme consists mainly of agency products from leading international manufacturers and, in addition, some manufacture of own products, combined with service and support for the products. The Group creates added value by contributing: technical competence to the products; accounting for knowledge and experience about the market; and by providing efficient logistics and warehousing.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Operations are carried out by region within the Beijer Ref, which comprises Beijer Ref ARW (Air conditioning, refrigeration, wholesale) and Toshiba&rsquo;s distribution operation within air conditioning and heating. The Beijer Ref Group is a leading operator within the refrigeration sector in Europe and has a significant position within air conditioning in Europe. The operation is split into six geographic segments: Nordic countries, Southern Europe, Central Europe, Eastern <br /> Europe, Africa and Asia Pacific. Growth is achieved both organically and through the acquisition of companies which supplement existing operations.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Seasonal effects</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Beijer Ref&rsquo;s sales are seasonally dependent as demand for refrigeration and air conditioning is at its peak during the warm months of the year. It means that demand in the northern hemisphere is at its peak during the second and third quarters whilst demand in the southern hemisphere is at its peak during the first and fourth quarters. </span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 14pt"><strong>Stable quarter ends a good year</strong></span></p><p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Net sales for the fourth quarter of 2016 increased by 8.5 per cent compared with the corresponding period in the previous year and amounted to SEK 2,199M (2,027). The increase is mainly due to the acquired companies, HRP and Realcold.</p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Good development for Commercial &amp; Industrial refrigeration. Slightly weaker development for HVAC.</p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Operating profit for the fourth quarter of 2016 amounted to SEK 145M (134). It is an improvement of 8.0 per cent compared with the same period last year.</p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Profit for the quarter amounted to SEK 100M (84), an increase of 18.6 per cent compared with the same period last year.</p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Profit per share amounted to SEK 9.17 (8.64).</p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual Meeting of shareholders resolves that an increased dividend of SEK 5.50 (5.25) per share shall be paid.</p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 22pt">Comments by the CEO</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Stable quarter ends a good year</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Beijer Ref ended 2016 with a stable quarter and a profit increase. The development was especially positive during November and December and we are of the opinion that this trend will continue into the new year. Our largest market segment, Commercial &amp; Industrial refrigeration, enjoyed a positive development during the quarter, whilst HVAC was slightly weaker than in the corresponding quarter of the previous year. Viewed over the full year, however, HVAC enjoyed a stronger development than Commercial &amp; Industrial refrigeration. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt">Strong quarter in Central Europe</span></strong><span style="font-size: 10pt"> </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">In Central Europe, the restructuring work with HRP in the United Kingdom is beginning to generate an effect. We were delayed by the examination by the Competition &amp; Markets Authority in the UK (CMA), but were able to complete our work of integrating HRP during the autumn and contributed to a positive result for the fourth quarter. The other companies in the region also enjoyed a positive development. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp; In the Nordic countries, the result was slightly lower than for the corresponding period in the previous year. This is mainly because the comparative figures for the corresponding quarter in the previous year were unusually high. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp; The result in Southern Europe was affected by the fact that we took on costs in order to achieve better logistics and a more cost-efficient organisation in France. In addition, demand in the market for indoor climate control slowed down slightly. On a full year basis, however, the region reports a positive stable development. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp; Asia Pacific developed strongly in line with forecasts and Africa shows a stable positive development. During the quarter, we opened an operation in Tanzania, which becomes our seventh market in Africa. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp; Taken together, it is gratifying that we have reversed the development in the newly-acquired company in the United Kingdom. This acquisition now shows positive results. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt">Important resolution in Kigali</span></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">At a summit meeting in the capital of Rwanda, Kigali, in October, 170 countries agreed to phase out hydrogen fluoride carbon gases (HFC gases), which contribute to global warning. A decision to phase out HFC has already been taken within the EU, but through the agreement in Kigali the phasing out of HFC will also be initiated in other large markets such as the USA and Japan starting as early as 2019. Other countries in the agreement will follow in accordance with an established timetable, with a final start in 2028 in countries such as India and Pakistan. Through our broad offer of eco-friendly alternatives to HFC solutions, the decision provides good opportunities for Beijer Ref in a growing global market. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><strong><span style="font-size: 10pt">Continued investment in OEM</span></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">During the quarter, we continued to expand the range of products manufactured internally and will launch new products during 2017. This operation is now increasing more rapidly than the traditional distribution operation. The OEM investment strengthens our offer in the market towards, among others, food stores. The OEM offer is important in enabling us to meet the increasing demand for eco-friendly solutions which we see in Europe and also increasingly in Australia and New Zealand. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp; We are also continuing our work in digitalising our operation, which will lead to cost savings and increased efficiency in the long term. Our local presence is decisive for good customer relations, but through the digitalisation we also see new market opportunities. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp; Taken together, I look back on a good last quarter of 2016 and a year that has involved an all-time-high for both sales and results. Beijer Ref&rsquo;s Board of Directors proposes an increased dividend to SEK 5.50 (5.25), which should be seen as a confirmation of yet another good year for the Group. We stand well equipped to face the future and are looking forward to 2017 with confidence.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Per Bertland</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 22pt">Fourth quarter of 2016</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Sales</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Beijer Ref increased its net sales by 8.5 per cent to SEK 2,199M (2,027) for the fourth quarter of 2016. The sales increase emanates mainly from the acquired companies, HRP and Realcold. When adjusted for exchange rate fluctuations and acquisitions, the organic sales change was -1.0 per cent. The decrease in organic sales is attributable to the weaker HVAC market in Europe. In 2015, the HVAC market in Europe was strongly influenced by the heat wave, the effects of which on demand continued into the fourth quarter and gave strong comparative figures in 2016. The market segment, Commercial &amp; Industrial refrigeration, increased by one per cent. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">During the year, net sales increased by 8.2 per cent to SEK 9,045M (8,361). When adjusted for exchange rate fluctuations and acquisitions, the organic sales change was 2.8 per cent.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Results</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">The Group&rsquo;s operating profit amounted to SEK 145 M (134) for the fourth quarter, equivalent to an increase of 8.0 per cent. The increase in profit is partly explained by the contribution from the acquired companies, HRP and Realcold.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">The operating margin in the quarter is on a par with the same period in the previous year, 6.6 per cent (6.6). </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">When adjusted for exchange rate fluctuations and acquisitions, the organic change in operating profit was -1.7 per cent for the quarter, for the same reason as sales. For the full year, operating profit increased by 4.5 per cent to SEK 593M (567). When adjusted for exchange rate fluctuations and acquisitions, the organic operating profit increase was 2.7 per cent. The Group&rsquo;s financial income/expense amounted to SEK -33M (-42) for the year. Profit before tax was SEK 560M (525). Profit for the period was 399M (373). Profit per share amounted to SEK 9.17 (8.64).</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Dividend</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">The Board of Directors proposes that the Annual Meeting of shareholders resolves that a dividend of SEK 5.50 (5.25) per share shall be paid for the 2016 financial year. This is equivalent to a total of SEK 232.7M if the shares currently held by the company are excluded.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Cash flow</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Cash flow from the current operation before change in working capital was SEK 481M for the 12 months of 2016 compared with SEK 488M for the corresponding period in the previous year. During 12 months, the working capital has increased by SEK 416M (-7), partly as a result of the increased business volume and the acquired companies, HRP and Realcold. This gives a cash flow from the current operation of SEK 65M compared with SEK 495M in the previous year.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Investments</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">The Group&rsquo;s capital expenditure including business combinations amounted to SEK 80M (237) for the year. The difference when compared with the previous year is due to minor influence from acquisitions.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Significant events during the year </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">During the first quarter, the UK Competition &amp; Markets Authority (CMA) began an examination of our acquisition of HRP Ltd with 15 branches in the United Kingdom. On 8 June, CMA announced that it had no objections to the transaction. The planned restructuring work could therefore begin. HRP is included in the consolidated accounts as from June. </span>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Risk assessment</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">The operation of the Beijer Ref Group is affected by a number of external factors, the effects of which on the Group&rsquo;s operating profit can be controlled to a varying degree. The Group&rsquo;s operation is dependent on the general economic trend, especially in Europe, which controls the demand for Beijer Ref&rsquo;s products and services. Acquisitions are normally linked with risks such as, for example, staff defection. Other operating risks, such as agency and supplier agreements, product responsibility and delivery undertaking, technical development, warranties, dependence on individuals, etc., are continually being analysed and, when necessary, action is taken to reduce the Group&rsquo;s risk exposure. In its operation, Beijer Ref is exposed to financial risks such as currency risk, interest risk and liquidity risk. The parent company&rsquo;s risk picture is the same as that of the Group. For further information see the Group&rsquo;s Annual Report.</span></p>

<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">The Beijer Ref Group is focused on trading and distribution operations within refrigeration products, air conditioning and heat pumps. The product programme consists mainly of agency products from leading international manufacturers and, in addition, some manufacture of own products, combined with service and support for the products. The Group creates added value by contributing: technical competence to the products; accounting for knowledge and experience about the market; and by providing efficient logistics and warehousing.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Operations are carried out by region within the Beijer Ref, which comprises Beijer Ref ARW (Air conditioning, refrigeration, wholesale) and Toshiba&rsquo;s distribution operation within air conditioning and heating. The Beijer Ref Group is a leading operator within the refrigeration sector in Europe and has a significant position within air conditioning in Europe. The operation is split into six geographic segments: Nordic countries, Southern Europe, Central Europe, Eastern Europe, Africa and Asia Pacific. Growth is achieved both organically and through the acquisition of companies which supplement existing operations.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Seasonal effects</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Beijer Ref&rsquo;s sales are seasonally dependent as demand for refrigeration and air conditioning is at its peak during the warm months of the year. It means that demand in the northern hemisphere is at its peak during the second and third quarters whilst demand in the southern hemisphere is at its peak during the first and fourth quarters. </span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 14pt"><strong>Weak start of the quarter but gradual improvement</strong></span></p><p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Net sales for the third quarter of 2016 increased by 5.4 per cent compared with the corresponding period in the previous year and amounted to SEK 2,461M (2,335). The increase is mainly due to the acquisition of HRP in the United Kingdom and Realcold in Australia/New Zealand.</p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Weak month of July. Organic growth in August and September.</p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Operating profit for the third quarter of 2016 amounted to SEK 173M (181).</p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Profit for the quarter amounted to SEK 117M (121).</p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Profit per share amounted to SEK 2.71 (2.82).</p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 22pt">Comments by the CEO</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Weak start of the quarter but gradual improvement </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Although profit for the quarter did not reach the level of the previous year, the third quarter of the year was one of our strongest quarters ever. Only the month of July was the weak month of the quarter, whilst both August and September showed growth, organically as well as incrementally. The heatwave Europe experienced in July last year, which at the time had a strong impact on demand, was not repeated this year.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">In our regional markets, the Nordic countries stand out negatively, mainly due to a weaker development in Sweden. We see this as a normal fluctuation as there is no business cycle or structural signs that would indicate demand is declining. Central Europe shows growth, mainly due to the fact that the acquisition of HRP in the United Kingdom has been consolidated. In the region, we can also see a positive development in markets such as the Netherlands, Switzerland and Germany. The Southern Europe region was affected by the cooler weather during July compared with the previous year. Eastern Europe shows a positive development in Czech Republic, Slovakia, Romania and the Baltic States. The markets in Africa also show growth in local currency and in Asia Pacific we see an excellent development, especially in Malaysia and New Zealand. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">The work of making our own organisation even more efficient continues through the creation of a clear structure with a country manager and a joint back-office in every country. The United Kingdom, France, the Netherlands and Norway are the remaining countries in which we are currently implementing these measures which will give us a more efficient organisation and clear cost savings. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">During the quarter, we have initiated the work of strengthening our digital competence. There are significant opportunities with digitalisation in our sector and the objective is to develop our digital capacity. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">We are working with our own organisation and our cost side, and are also continually evaluating new acquisition opportunities. Taken together, the outcome for the quarter is lower than anticipated. However, the development in August and September gives us confidence for the next quarter. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Per Bertland</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">CEO, Beijer Ref</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 22pt">Third quarter of 2016</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Sales</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Beijer Ref increased its net sales by 5.4 per cent to SEK 2,461M (2,335) for the third quarter of 2016. When adjusted for exchange rate fluctuations and acquisitions, the organic change in sales was -2.0 per cent. The decrease in sales is attributable to the fact that sales for the month of July did not reach the previous year&rsquo;s level. The month of July in the previous year was strongly influenced by a heatwave through large parts of Europe. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Net sales for the first three quarters of the year increased by 8.1 per cent to SEK 6,845M (6,334). When adjusted for exchange rate fluctuations and acquisitions, the organic sales change was 4.1 per cent.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Results</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">The Group&rsquo;s operating profit amounted to SEK 173M (181) for the third quarter, equivalent to a decrease of 4.5 per cent. The result decrease is mainly explained by the lower sales in the month of July as described above under the section about sales. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">The lower operating margin for the quarter, 7.0 per cent (7.7), is mainly explained the fact that HRP and Realcold were acquired and that these companies initially have lower margins that the average in the Group.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">When adjusted for exchange rate fluctuations and acquisitions, the organic decrease in operating profit was 6.7 per cent during the quarter. For the first three quarters of the year, operating profit increased by 3.4 per cent to SEK 448M (443). When adjusted for exchange rate fluctuations and acquisitions, the organic increase in operating profit was 4.1 per cent. The Group&rsquo;s financial income/expense amounted to SEK -25M (-27) for the first three months of the year. Profit before tax was SEK 423M (406). Net profit for the period was SEK 299M (289). Profit per share amounted to SEK 6.88 (6.69).</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Cash flow</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Cash flow from the current operation before change in working capital was SEK 381M for the first nine months of 2016 compared with SEK 411M for the corresponding period in the previous year. During the first nine months of the year, the working capital increased by SEK 352M compared with SEK 130M for the same period in the previous year, as a result of the increased business volume and the acquisitions of HRP and Realcold. This gives a cash flow from the current operation of SEK 29M compared with SEK 281M in the previous year.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Investments</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Consolidated capital expenditure, including acquisitions, amounted to SEK 66M (188) for the first nine months of 2016.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Significant events during the year </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">During the first quarter, the UK Competition &amp; Markets Authority (CMA) initiated an examination of our acquisition of HRP Ltd with 15 branches in the United Kingdom. On 8 June, CMA announced that it had no objections to the transaction. As a result, we were able to start our planned restructuring work. HRP is included in the Group&rsquo;s accounts as from June. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Risk assessment</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">The operation of the Beijer Ref Group is affected by a number of external factors, the effects of which on the Group&rsquo;s operating profit can be controlled to a varying degree. The Group&rsquo;s operation is dependent on the general economic trend, especially in Europe, which controls the demand for Beijer Ref&rsquo;s products and services. Acquisitions are normally linked with risks such as, for example, staff defection. Other operating risks, such as agency and supplier agreements, product responsibility and delivery undertaking, technical development, warranties, dependence on individuals, etc., are continually being analysed and, when necessary, action is taken to reduce the Group&rsquo;s risk exposure. In its operation, Beijer Ref is exposed to financial risks such as currency risk, interest risk and liquidity risk. The parent company&rsquo;s risk picture is the same as that of the Group. For further information see the Group&rsquo;s Annual Report.</span></p>

<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Beijer Ref in short</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">The Beijer Ref Group is focused on trading and distribution operations within refrigeration products, air conditioning and heat pumps. The product programme consists mainly of agency products from leading international manufacturers and, in addition, some manufacture of own products, combined with service and support for the products. The Group creates added value by contributing: technical competence to the products; accounting for knowledge and experience about the market; and by providing efficient logistics and warehousing.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Operations are carried out by region within the Beijer Ref, which comprises Beijer Ref ARW (Air conditioning, refrigeration, wholesale) and Toshiba&rsquo;s distribution operation within air conditioning and heating. The Beijer Ref Group is a leading operator within the refrigeration sector in Europe and has a significant position within air conditioning in Europe. The operation is split into six geographic segments: Nordic countries, Southern Europe, Central Europe, Eastern Europe, Africa and Asia Pacific. Growth is achieved both organically and through the acquisition of companies which supplement existing operations.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Seasonal effects</span>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 11pt">Beijer Ref&rsquo;s sales are seasonally dependent as demand for refrigeration and air conditioning is at its peak during the warm months of the year. It means that demand in the northern hemisphere is at its peak during the second and third quarters whilst demand in the southern hemisphere is at its peak during the first and fourth quarters. </span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span style="font-size:;font-family:"><strong></strong></span></p><p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>The Election Committee in Beijer Ref AB has decided to put forward the following proposal to the 2019 Annual Meeting of shareholders relating to the number of Board Members and the election of Board Members. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>The Election committee proposes that the number of Members of the Board of Directors shall be seven. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>The Election Committee proposes the re-election as Board Members of Bernt Ingman, Joen Magnusson, Peter Jessen J&uuml;rgensen, Monica Gimre, Frida Norrbom Sams and William Striebe. In addition, the Election Committee proposes that Chris Nelson is elected as Board Member. Ross B. Shuster does not stand for re-election. The Election Committee also proposes the re-election of Bernt Ingman as Chairman of the Board of Directors. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Based on the company&rsquo;s operation, its phase of development and market conditions in general, the Election Committee has discussed the Board of Directors&rsquo; diversity, size and composition relating to sector experience, competence, gender balance, and international experience. To replace Ross B Shuster, who is not standing for re-election, the Election Committee has deemed it desirable to supplement the Board of Directors with an international member with broad industry experience and experience of sales and leadership. Chris Nelson is President, Commercial HVAC, for Carrier Corporation, leading the global commercial HVAC product and service portfolio. He has more than 24 years of sales and general management experience and is employed in UTC/Carrier since 2004. Chris holds a bachelor&rsquo;s degree from the University of Notre Dame and a master&rsquo;s degree in business from Cornell University and held leadership roles within the U.S. Army, Johnson &amp; Johnson and McKinsey &amp; Company. Chris Nelson is independent in relation to Beijer Ref and its management but dependent in relation to the company&rsquo;s largest shareholder.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>The Election Committee is of the opinion that Chris Nelson&rsquo;s experience well meets the desired competence profile. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>The Annual Meeting of shareholders will be held at 3 pm on 10 April 2019 at B&ouml;rshuset, Skeppsbron 2, Malm&ouml;. Registration for the Meeting will start at 2 pm. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>In connection with the publication of the Notice of the Annual Meeting of shareholders on 6 March 2019, the Election Committee&rsquo;s full proposal and justified statement will be made public.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 14pt"><strong>Increased profit and dividend</strong></span></p><p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Net sales for the fourth quarter of 2018 increased by 37% compared with the corresponding period in the previous year and totalled SEK 3,293 million (2,401).</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>The operating profit for the fourth quarter of 2018 totalled SEK 229 million (179), an increase of 28% compared with the same period last year.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>The profit for the period totalled SEK 164 million (146). Profit per share totalled SEK 1.28 (1.13).</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>During the fourth quarter, Beijer Ref AB issued a commercial paper scheme totalling SEK 700 million as part of the company&rsquo;s existing financing. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Repurchases of 123,171 class B shares took place during the quarter. The company has now secured access to shares in accordance with the company&rsquo;s long-term incentive scheme, which runs between 2018 and 2021.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>As of 2 January 2019, the Beijer Ref share is being traded on Nasdaq Stockholm's Large Cap.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>The Board of Directors is proposing an increased dividend of SEK 3.00 per share (1.92) to the AGM.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Comments by the CEO</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><span>2018 - a record year</span></strong></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>2018 was a year of historical success for Beijer Ref. Net sales totalled just over SEK 13 billion, an increase of 32 per cent compared with the previous year. Organic growth was 13.4 per cent and the operating margin was 8.3 per cent. The profit for the year totalled SEK 780 million (521), an increase of 50 per cent. Profit per share totalled SEK 6.07 (4.02). This makes 2018 Beijer Ref&rsquo;s strongest year to date.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>During the fourth quarter, net sales increased by 37 per cent, 9.4 per cent of which comprised organic growth. The operating margin for the period was 6.9 per cent, slightly lower than in the previous year, primarily because the overseas share of sales increased due to the acquired companies in Africa, Australia and China. Comparative figures are also at a relatively high level, as the prices of refrigerants started to rise in the autumn of 2017. The profit represents the Group&rsquo;s best-ever fourth quarter. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Both the full year and the fourth quarter were affected positively by the European phasing-out programme, which has driven demand for our green technology. It is now evident that the EU&rsquo;s F-Gas regulation is starting to make its mark outside Europe. In December, the UN held its major climate meeting in Katowice, Poland. This confirmed the content of the Paris agreement, including the more than 200 Member States being subjected to increased control with regard to follow-up on the regulatory framework. It is my assessment that the outcome will have positive consequences for our business in the years ahead. We are seeing more and more interest in and curiosity about both green, natural refrigerants and newly developed, synthetic so-called HFOs on other continents. We have already sold our green technology to customers in Australia, China and South Africa. I am convinced that we have only seen the beginning of this transition. The new technologies will gradually become established outside Europe as well.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>All of Beijer Ref&rsquo;s regions are reporting good growth, and the strong growth trend of the previous period is continuing in the Nordic region and Europe. It is also pleasing to see South Africa reporting growth again. The Asia Pacific region is also reporting satisfactory sales figures. The integration of the acquisitions TecsaReco in South Africa and Heatcraft in Australia has gone well, and both companies are now contributing to our profit.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Both commercial and comfort cooling have seen strong growth during the period. The after-sales market is stable, and project activities in the OEM business area continue to have high order input for green refrigeration installations. Work to implement our green refrigeration technology outside Europe is under way, and the plan is for the first non-European systems to be manufactured in South Africa in early 2019. Work is continuing to expand European production capacity in order to meet the growing demand in Europe.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Comfort cooling has performed well during the quarter with growth of almost 50 per cent, of which 22 per cent was organic. Successful partnerships with our strategic suppliers Toshiba, Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and Carrier are having an effect. Together we have gained additional market shares. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Refrigerant prices have fallen slightly compared with the previous quarter, but they remain at a high level. Our earlier assessment, that prices will stabilise during the second quarter of 2019, still holds true.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>We face 2019 with confidence. With a growing market and an increased need for our products and technology, opportunities for growth are good, both organically and through acquisitions. We are working continuously to analyse opportunities to add strategic companies to our Group. This year&rsquo;s strong cash flow and balance sheet create the conditions for this. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>All in all, 2018 was another record year. The Board of Beijer Ref proposes an increased dividend of SEK 3.00 (1.92).</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><span>Per Bertland</span></strong><span>, CEO</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Fourth quarter of 2018</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><span>NET SALES</span></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Beijer Ref increased its net sales by 37 per cent to SEK 3,293 million (2,401) in the fourth quarter of 2018, primarily due to a higher proportion of sales outside Europe, which has its high season during the winter months, and continued high prices, especially of refrigerants. All regions report growth in net sales. Adjusted for exchange rate changes and acquisitions, organic growth in net sales was 9.4 per cent. A weakened Swedish krona resulted in currency effects of SEK 117 million, corresponding to 5.3% since most of the company&rsquo;s net sales take place in currencies other than Swedish kronor.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Net sales during the year increased by 32 per cent to SEK 13,015 million (9,830). Adjusted for exchange rate changes and acquisitions, organic growth in net sales was 13.4 per cent.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><span>PROFIT</span></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>The Group&rsquo;s operating profit totalled SEK 229 million (179) during the fourth quarter, an increase of 28 per cent. The company had a higher share of sales in Asia Pacific at lower margins during the quarter. Comparative figures for refrigerants are at a relatively high level, as prices had already started to rise in the autumn of 2017.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>The operating profit increased during the year by 50 per cent to SEK 1,085 million (725). Adjusted for exchange rate changes and acquisitions, the organic increase in the operating profit was 36 per cent. During the year, the Group&rsquo;s net financial items totalled SEK -31 million (-26) due to increased borrowing, mainly because of the acquisitions completed during the year. The pre-tax profit was SEK 1,055 million (699). The profit for the year was SEK 780 million (521). Profit per share totalled SEK 6.07 (4.02).</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><span>CASH FLOW</span></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Cash flow from operating activities before change in working capital was SEK 949 million in 2018 compared with SEK 642 million for 2017, primarily due to the improved profit. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Working capital increased by SEK 282 million during the year compared with SEK 140 million the previous year. This produces cash flow from operating activities of SEK 667 million, compared with SEK 502 million the previous year. The change in working capital between the years is due primarily to growth in net sales and some build-up of stocks. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>At the end of the year, the company has unutilised credit facilities totalling SEK 1,433 million (496). </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><span>INVESTMENTS</span></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>The Group&rsquo;s investments in fixed assets including business combinations totalled SEK 1,057 million (101) during the year and relate primarily to the acquisitions of TecsaReco, Heatcraft and Lumelco. During the year the company also invested SEK 87 million (0) in the repurchase of its own shares after deduction of the option premium received.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><span>DIVIDEND</span></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>The Board of Directors proposes a dividend for 2018 of SEK 3.00 (1.92) per share, corresponding to a total dividend payment of SEK 380M (244) based on the number of outstanding shares at the end of 2018. It is also proposed that the dividend is to be paid in two installments, in April and October, in order to better match the Group's seasonality. The proposed record dates are 12 April and 11 October 2019 respectively.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><span>SIGNIFICANT EVENTS DURING THE QUARTER </span></strong><span> </span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>No acquisitions were made during the quarter, but the company is continuously evaluating new opportunities for growth and complementary acquisitions. During the quarter, the integration of Heatcraft in Australia in particular was implemented, which is expected to produce additional profit improvements in future.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>The company has exercised the AGM&rsquo;s authorisation to repurchase its own shares following a decision on a long-term incentive scheme for senior executives. In total, the company repurchased 123,171 shares during the quarter and now holds 897,980 shares at an average purchase value of SEK 111. The incentive scheme runs between 2018 and 2021. The total cost of the scheme is in line with the Board&rsquo;s proposal and the AGM&rsquo;s decision, i.e. SEK 8 million, and was charged to the company&rsquo;s operating profit in 2018.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>In the fourth quarter, Beijer Ref AB set up a commercial paper scheme with a financial envelope of SEK 1,500 million as part of Beijer Ref&rsquo;s financing. The organiser of the scheme was Handelsbanken and the issuing agents are Handelsbanken and Nordea. The company has available credit facilities corresponding to the amount issued, which totalled SEK 700 million. The scheme will have a positive effect on the company&rsquo;s net financial income.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><span>OTHER SIGNIFICANT EVENTS DURING THE YEAR</span></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>The company's acquisition of TecsaReco in South Africa was completed on 1 March 2018, since when it has been included in the company&rsquo;s accounts. Annual net sales total approximately SEK 450 million and the company has approximately 300 employees and 23 branches. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Beijer Ref acquired Heatcraft Australia Pty Ltd in May 2018. The company has just over 300 employees and net sales of approximately SEK 1.1 billion. The acquisition also included operations in China and Singapore.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>In July 2018, Beijer Ref and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Air Conditioning Europe Ltd completed the formation of the subsidiary 3D Plus, with Beijer Ref as the majority shareholder. The company only had a marginal impact on the profit in 2018.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>The acquisition of the Spanish air conditioning company Lumelco S.A. is included in the company's accounts as of August 2018 and strengthens Beijer Ref&rsquo;s position in the comfort cooling segment. The company has annual net sales of approximately SEK 400 million and over 60 employees. The acquisition is expected to generate long-term positive effects in terms of both net sales and profit.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>All in all, these acquisitions represent an increase in net sales of approximately SEK 2 billion and 660 full-time equivalent employees.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><span>SIGNIFICANT EVENTS AFTER THE END OF THE PERIOD </span></strong></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>As of 2 January 2019, the Beijer Ref share is being traded on Nasdaq Stockholm's Large Cap.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><span>RISK DESCRIPTION</span></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>The Beijer Ref Group&rsquo;s operations are subject to a number of business environment factors, the effects of which on the Group&rsquo;s operating profit can be controlled to varying degrees. The Group&rsquo;s operations depend on general economic trends, primarily in Europe, which determine demand for Beijer Ref&rsquo;s products and services. Acquisitions are normally associated with risks, for example loss of key employees. Other operating risks, such as agency and supplier agreements, product liability and delivery commitments, technical development, warranties, dependence on key individuals, etc., are analysed continually. Where necessary, measures are taken to reduce the Group&rsquo;s risk exposure. In its operations, Beijer Ref is subject to financial risks such as currency risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk. The Parent&rsquo;s risk profile is the same as that of the Group. For further information, see the Group&rsquo;s Annual Report.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><span>ACCOUNTING POLICIES</span></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>This interim report was prepared in accordance with IAS 34, the Swedish Annual Accounts Act and RFR 2. Beijer Ref continues to apply the same accounting policies and valuation methods as described in the most recent annual report.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Effects regarding the implementation of IFRS 15 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers and IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments have been analysed at both Group and subsidiary level. The new standards do not have any material impact on the Group&rsquo;s financial statements other than increased disclosure requirements. The prospective method has been applied from January 2018.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><em><span>Estimated effects of the transition to IFRS 16 Leases</span></em>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Beijer Ref has assessed the effect of the transition to the new accounting standard IFRS 16 Leases, which will be applied as of 1 January 2019. The initial assessment is that IFRS 16 will have a positive effect on the operating profit and a minor positive effect on the profit after financial items. The estimated effects on the balance sheet are described in the table below. The lease portfolio contains approximately 1,500 contracts and comprises primarily operational leases for offices, warehouses, company cars, forklift trucks and office equipment. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Beijer Ref has identified many agreements, primarily relating to properties, with the right to extend. As a result of these considerations, many leases have been deemed to be longer.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Beijer Ref has chosen to report the transition to the new standard using the simplified method. The relief rule not to create a comparative year has been applied. A discount rate has been defined for each per country. Right of use agreements of less than 12 months are reported as short-term agreements and are therefore not included in the reported liabilities or rights of use. Right of use agreements with a acquisition value below USD 5,000 have been classified as low-value agreements and are not included in the reported liabilities or rights of use.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>This interim report for Beijer Ref AB (publ) has been submitted following approval by the Board of Directors.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 14pt"><strong>Continued strong quarter</strong></span></p><p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Net sales for the third quarter of 2018 increased by 41% compared with the corresponding period in the previous year and totalled SEK 3,607 million (2,555).</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>The operating profit for the third quarter of 2018 totalled SEK 339 million (217), an increase of 57% compared with the same period last year.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>The profit for the period totalled SEK 240 million (149).</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Profit per share totalled SEK 1.88 (1.16).</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Beijer Ref AB and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Air Conditioning Europe LTD completed the formation of the subsidiary 3D Plus in the UK, with Beijer Ref as the majority shareholder. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>The acquisition of the Spanish air conditioning company Lumelco S.A. strengthens the Group&rsquo;s position in field of air conditioning in Southern Europe. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Repurchases of 181,559 class B shares took place during the quarter. The purpose of the repurchase is to secure access to shares in accordance with the company&rsquo;s long-term incentive scheme, 2018-2021.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Comments by the CEO</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><span>Growing market creates strong quarter</span></strong></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>We can look back on another quarter of strong growth. Net sales increased by 41 per cent and the profit increased by 57 per cent compared with the same period in 2017. This is our strongest third quarter ever. Adjusted for acquisitions and currency effects, net sales increased organically by approximately 16 per cent and the profit by 42 per cent. All regions are reporting growth in line with our expectations, although Europe does stand out. Of the European regions, the Nordic region has distinguished itself just a little extra. An unusually warm summer resulted in record net sales and profits for the region, with an organic increase in net sales of 30 per cent, while the profit doubled. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>The profit for the quarter shows once again that our market is strong. The F-gas regulation in Europe is accelerating the phasing out of existing refrigerants, known as fluorinated gases, and is one of the main reasons why demand for Beijer Ref&rsquo;s products is increasing. The phase-out programme is continuing, and we see no signs of reduced activity. The UN recently issued an updated climate report highlighting how urgent it is that global warming remains at a maximum of 1.5 degrees by the year 2100. This is half a degree lower than the goal of the Paris Agreement. Achieving this new goal requires substantially increased measures, according to the IPCC, the UN&rsquo;s climate panel. Our industry has a great responsibility in this matter and we must be proactive if this goal is to be achieved. Beijer Ref&rsquo;s focus on developing eco-friendly solutions therefore feels even more urgent. We have a long tradition and a great deal of knowledge of such technology in Europe. We are now passing on this know-how to our companies on other continents. The fact that the economy remains strong also means that end customers are prepared to invest and upgrade their refrigeration and air-conditioning systems to an even greater extent, which benefits us.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>We also want to grow through acquisitions in Europe and in the rest of the world. During the quarter, Beijer Ref acquired the Spanish air conditioning distributor Lumelco. This deal consolidates the Group&rsquo;s position within the HVAC segment in Beijer Ref&rsquo;s biggest region, Southern Europe. The company distributes several strong brands, but primarily has exclusive distribution rights with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, one of Beijer Ref&rsquo;s strategic partners. Strengthening and developing relationships with our main suppliers is in line with our strategy. Lumelco is included in our accounts as of August this year. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>During the transfer phase to eco-friendly refrigeration technology, we have seen sharp increases in the price of HFC refrigerants with the most negative environmental impact. These price increases are a direct consequence of the European regulatory framework for the phasing out of F-gases. At present these price rises have slowed down, and the assessment is that prices will remain stable over the next few quarters. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Our logistics chain is one of our strengths, and we are working to create sustainable, modern solutions that deliver efficiency throughout the entire flow. At the beginning of the year we opened a new, large, automated logistics centre in the Netherlands, known as the Beijer Ref Support Center. This enables us to achieve efficiency improvements above all in the areas of purchasing, logistics and back office. As another step in the same direction, we recently opened a similar centre in Auckland, New Zealand. Passing on best practice within the Group is important and an advantage that we want to use to the maximum.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>All in all, we are satisfied with the period and we enter the fourth quarter with both humility and strong self-belief. Going forward, we want to grow further. With increased profits, low interest rates and a strong cash flow, we are well placed to make more supplementary acquisitions.</span></p>

<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>CEO</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Third quarter of 2018</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><span>NET SALES</span></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Beijer Ref increased its net sales by 41 per cent to SEK 3,607 million (2,555) in the third quarter of 2018. A strong global economy, favourable weather conditions that increase demand for air conditioning, and price rises in particular for refrigerants have resulted in continued strong growth in net sales. All regions report an increase in net sales of more than 20 per cent in the third quarter. Adjusted for exchange rate changes and acquisitions, organic growth in net sales was 16 per cent. A weakened Swedish krona resulted in currency effects of SEK 195 million (-22), corresponding to 8.8% since most of the company&rsquo;s net sales take place in currencies other than Swedish kronor.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><span>PROFIT</span></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>The Group&rsquo;s operating profit totalled SEK 339 million (217) during the third quarter, an increase of 57 per cent. The ongoing transition to eco-friendly refrigeration systems had a positive impact on the profit for the period and also resulted in increased demand for HVAC and OEM, which are future growth segments for Beijer Ref. Adjusted for exchange rate changes and acquisitions, the organic improvement in the operating profit was 42 per cent.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><span>CASH FLOW</span></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Cash flow from operating activities before change in working capital was SEK 829 million during the first nine-month period of 2018, compared with SEK 500 million for 2017, primarily due to the significantly improved profit. Working capital increased by SEK 585 million during the first nine-month period compared with SEK 134 million the previous year. This produces cash flow from operating activities of SEK 243 million, compared with SEK 366 million the previous year. The change in working capital between the years is due primarily to sales growth and some build-up of stocks. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><span>INVESTMENTS</span></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>The Group&rsquo;s investments in fixed assets including business combinations totalled SEK 1,011 million (72) during the first nine-month period and relate primarily to the acquisitions of Tecsa, Heatcraft and Lumelco, which were financed by external borrowing from existing bank partners. During the period the company also invested the net sum of SEK 70 million in the repurchase of own shares after deduction of the option premium received.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><span>SIGNIFICANT EVENTS DURING THE QUARTER</span></strong><span> </span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>On 2 July 2018, Beijer Ref AB and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Air Conditioning Europe Ltd completed the formation of the subsidiary 3D Plus, with Beijer Ref as the majority shareholder. The new company is now operating under the leadership of a new CEO. 3D Plus&rsquo;s head office is in Slough, with regional offices planned in the UK and Ireland. The formation of the subsidiary is only having a marginal effect on net sales in 2018, but it is considered to have good growth potential.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>The acquisition of the Spanish air conditioning company Lumelco S.A. is included in the company&rsquo;s accounts as of August and strengthens the Group&rsquo;s position in the HVAC segment in Beijer Ref&rsquo;s biggest region, Southern Europe. The company is a long-time distributor of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries&rsquo; products in Spain and Portugal, one of Beijer Ref&rsquo;s strategic suppliers. The company has net sales of approximately SEK 400 million and over 60 employees. The takeover has only a marginal effect on the profit in 2018. The acquisition is, however, expected to generate long-term positive effects in terms of both net sales and profit.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>During the quarter, the company exercised the AGM&rsquo;s authorisation to repurchase its own shares following a decision on a long-term incentive scheme for senior executives. In total, the company repurchased 181,559 shares during the quarter and now holds 774,809 shares at an average purchase value of SEK 107. The incentive scheme runs between 2018-2021. The costs of the scheme are in line with the Board&rsquo;s proposal and the AGM&rsquo;s decision, i.e. SEK 8 million, and were charged to the company&rsquo;s operating profit in 2018.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><span>IMPORTANT EVENTS AFTER THE END OF THE PERIOD </span></strong></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>In the fourth quarter, Beijer Ref AB will establish a commercial paper scheme with a financial envelope of SEK 1,500 million as a complement to Beijer Ref&rsquo;s bank financing. The organiser of the scheme is Handelsbanken and the issuing agents are Handelsbanken and Nordea. The company will guarantee available credit facilities corresponding to the amount issued.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><span>RISK DESCRIPTION</span></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>The Beijer Ref Group&rsquo;s operations are subject to a number of business environment factors, the effects of which on the Group&rsquo;s operating profit can be controlled to varying degrees. The Group&rsquo;s operations depend on general economic trends, primarily in Europe, which determine demand for Beijer Ref&rsquo;s products and services. Acquisitions are normally associated with risks, for example loss of key employees. Other operating risks, such as agency and supplier agreements, product liability and delivery commitments, technical development, warranties, dependence on key individuals, etc., are analysed continually. Where necessary, measures are taken to reduce the Group&rsquo;s risk exposure. In its operations, Beijer Ref is subject to financial risks such as currency risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk. The Parent&rsquo;s risk profile is the same as that of the Group. For further information, see the Group&rsquo;s Annual Report.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><span>ACCOUNTING POLICIES</span></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>This interim report was prepared in accordance with IAS 34, the Swedish Annual Accounts Act and RFR 2. Beijer Ref continues to apply the same accounting policies and valuation methods as described in the most recent annual report.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Analyses of effects regarding the implementation of IFRS 15 - Revenue from Contracts with Customers and IFRS 9 - Financial Instruments have been performed at both Group and subsidiary level. The analyses show that the new standards do not have any material impact on the Group&rsquo;s financial statements other than increased disclosure requirements. The prospective method is applied from January 2018.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>IFRS 16 Leases &ndash; a new leasing standard that comes into effect on January 1, 2019. This standard requires that assets and liabilities attributable to all leases and rental agreements be recorded in the balance sheet. The Group is currently evaluating the effects. The Group&rsquo;s total assets will increase and at the same time, operating profit will increase compared with the current amount because some of the leasing payments will be recognized as interest expenses. Also, a several of the Group&rsquo;s key figures will be impacted by the new standard.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>This interim report for Beijer Ref AB (publ) has been submitted following approval by the Board of Directors.</span></p>

<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><span>INTRODUCTION</span></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>We have reviewed the condensed interim financial information (interim report) of Beijer Ref AB (publ) as of 30 September 2018 and the nine-month period then ended. The board of directors and the CEO are responsible for the preparation and presentation of the interim financial information in accordance with IAS 34 and the Swedish Annual Accounts Act. Our responsibility is to express a conclusion on this interim report based on our review.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><span>SCOPE OF REVIEW</span></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>We conducted our review in accordance with the International Standard on Review Engagements ISRE 2410, Review of Interim Report Performed by the Independent Auditor of the Entity. A review consists of making inquiries, primarily of persons responsible for financial and accounting matters, and applying analytical and other review procedures. A review is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted in accordance with International Standards on Auditing, ISA, and other generally accepted auditing standards in Sweden. The procedures performed in a review do not enable us to obtain assurance that we would become aware of all significant matters that might be identified in an audit. Accordingly, we do not express an audit opinion.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><span>CONCLUSION</span></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Based on our review, nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the interim report is not prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with IAS 34 and the Swedish Annual Accounts Act, regarding the Group, and with the Swedish Annual Accounts Act, regarding the Parent Company.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 12pt"><strong><strong>Beijer Ref AB has acquired Lumelco S.A. The transaction strengthens the Group's position within the HVAC segment in Beijer Ref&rsquo;s largest region Southern Europe.</strong></strong></span></p><p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif">Lumelco was founded in 1963 and is today one of the leading companies in the sale of air conditioning products with operations in Spain and Portugal. The company focuses on the distribution of leading brands in both the private and professional segments. Lumelco works closely with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and has exclusive rights to distribute the brand since more than 35 years. Lumelco also has other leading brands in its offer regarding solar heating systems and industrial warming products.</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif">Lumelco's headquarter is located in Madrid. The company has a total of 65 employees and sales in 2017 amounted to approximately SEK 400 million. The company has good profitability and its operations will be continued in its existing form under the brand Lumelco.</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif">Beijer Ref acquires Lumelco mainly from Lumbreras family and Diana Capital, a Spanish private equity fund.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif">Per Bertland, CEO Beijer Ref, comments:</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif">"With the acquisition of Lumelco, we grow within the HVAC segment, which is totally in line with our strategy. The need for air conditioning is increasing, especially in southern Europe. With this acquisition we further strengthen our business with a distributor who is closely linked to one of our major brands within HVAC - Mitsubishi Heavy Industries. We already distribute MHI Brand Air Conditioners and Heat Pump products in Great Britain, Ireland, Holland, the Nordics, Hungary, Australia and New Zealand. Now we are adding Spain and Portugal, which is very welcome."</p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 14pt"><strong>All in all, our best quarter so far.</strong></span></p><p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Net sales for the second quarter of 2018 increased by 32% compared with the corresponding period in the previous year and totalled SEK 3,510 million (2,657).</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>The operating profit for the second quarter of 2018 totalled SEK 345 million (223), an increase of 55% compared with the same period last year.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>The profit for the period totalled SEK 255 million (154).</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Profit per share for the quarter was SEK 1.98 (1.19).</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>The acquisition of Heatcraft Australia Pty Ltd is included in the company&rsquo;s accounts as of 5 May.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>The acquisition of the French HVAC distributor GH2C is included in the company&rsquo;s accounts as of 1 May, but has little impact on the company&rsquo;s profit and financial status.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>A 3:1 share split was carried out on 25 April in order to increase the liquidity in the share.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Comments by the CEO</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><span>More good news.</span></strong></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Beijer Ref continues to develop strongly. Net sales increased by a total of 32 per cent compared with the corresponding period last year. At the same time, the profit for the period increased by 65 per cent. All European regions are seeing strong organic growth in excess of 20 per cent. All in all, this is our strongest quarter so far. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>We are now seeing the F-gas regulation having a more and more of an impact on the European markets. This was particularly noticeable this quarter in the Nordic and Eastern European regions. Our biggest region, Southern Europe, is also performing strongly, which has a positive impact on profits. The ongoing regulation of F-gases and the time-specific phase-out programme benefit us. The fact that we have a large, eco-friendly offering for our customers during the actual transition phase means that we are well-positioned to meet the increasing demand in the market. Our OEM activities are also growing, the production of eco-friendly technology based primarily on natural refrigerants is running at full capacity, and we will continue to expand this production capacity. In addition to our existing plants in Europe, Africa and Asia, following the acquisition of Heatcraft we now also have production plants in Sydney, Australia and in Wuxi, China. We have a carefully considered plan describing how we will transfer our European knowledge in order to increase production in Asia Pacific, a process that is already under way. The same applies for South Africa, where we have production facilities in Johannesburg and Cape Town.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Another factor that is having a positive impact on the profit is price increases in certain refrigerants that took place because of the imbalance between supply and demand, which was caused by the F-gas regulation. We acted early here and made sure that we can offer our customers reliable deliveries. Furthermore, we have a strong range of air conditioning products that are winning market shares in a growing market. The acquisition of the French HVAC company GH2C, which was completed during the period, is a good fit with our strategy.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>In the second quarter we completed the acquisition of one of Australia&rsquo;s biggest refrigeration wholesalers, Heatcraft. Australia is in its winter period at the moment, and the company is therefore contributing primarily to increased net sales for Beijer Ref. At the same time, work on integration is going according to plan. The same applies for the acquisition of Tecsa in South Africa, which was incorporated into the books as of 1 March this year. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>In July we completed the formation of our joint venture together with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, which gives us exclusive rights, and the organisation is now in place to sell in the UK and Ireland.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>The completion of two major acquisitions means that we have increased our borrowing. Despite this, I believe that there is plenty of scope for more transactions. The strategy of acquiring additional companies in our segments of refrigeration, HVAC and OEM is firmly in place. The acquisitions, combined with price rises of refrigerants, have resulted in a slight increase in tied-up capital. Despite this, the return on operating capital has increased from 14 to 16 per cent.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>During the period we carried out a share split. Following this, both the share price and trading in the share increased, which meant that foreign interest in Beijer Ref has increased, which we feel is positive. After the AGM, key personnel were also offered the opportunity to participate in an option scheme. There is a high level of participation in the scheme, which I view as evidence that we are a cohesive team that believes in and is working for the development of Beijer Ref into an even more successful company.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><span>Per Bertland</span></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>CEO</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Second quarter of 2018</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><span>NET SALES</span></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Beijer Ref increased its net sales by 32 per cent to SEK 3,510 million (2,657) in the second quarter of 2018. A favourable economic situation and price rises, especially in refrigerants, have resulted in continued strong growth in demand, especially in Europe. All regions report an increase in net sales of more than 20 per cent in the second quarter. Adjusted for exchange rate changes and acquisitions, organic growth in net sales was 16 per cent.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><span>PROFIT</span></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>The Group&rsquo;s operating profit totalled SEK 345 million (223) during the second quarter, an increase of 55 per cent. The ongoing transition to eco-friendly refrigeration systems had a positive impact on the profit for the period and also increased demand for HVAC and OEM, which are future growth segments for Beijer Ref. Adjusted for exchange rate changes and acquisitions, the organic improvement in the operating profit was 47 percent.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><span>CASH FLOW</span></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Cash flow from operating activities before change in working capital was SEK 439 million during the first half of 2018 compared with SEK 308 million for 2017, primarily due to the improved profit. Working capital increased by SEK 387 million during the first half of the year compared with SEK 247 million the previous year. This produces cash flow from operating activities of SEK 52 million, compared with SEK 60 million the previous year. The change in working capital between the years is primarily due to the fact that working capital at the beginning of 2017 was at a higher than normal level, combined with some build-up of stocks.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><span>INVESTMENTS</span></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>The Group&rsquo;s investments in fixed assets including business combinations totalled SEK 975 million (50) during the first half of the year and relate primarily to the acquisitions of Heatcraft and Tecsa, which were financed by external borrowing.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><span>SIGNIFICANT EVENTS DURING THE QUARTER </span></strong><span> </span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Beijer Ref has completed the agreement to acquire Heatcraft Australia Pty Ltd. The company has just over 300 employees and net sales in 2017 totalled approximately SEK 1.1 billion. Sales take place through a large distribution network with more than 65 branches. This transaction sees Beijer Ref doubling its net sales in the Asia Pacific region. The acquisition also includes an operation in Singapore and a manufacturing unit in China. The company&rsquo;s profits are included in the company&rsquo;s accounts as of 5 May. The company makes a positive contribution to the increase in net sales, albeit with a slightly lower operating profit than other sections.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Following a resolution at the Annual General Meeting, Beijer Ref carried out a 3:1 share split on 25 April, which increased interest in the company&rsquo;s share and its liquidity. The company also exercised the AGM&rsquo;s authorisation to repurchase its own shares following a decision on a long-term incentive scheme for senior executives. In total, the company bought back 331,650 shares during the quarter and now holds 593,250 shares.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><span>IMPORTANT EVENTS AFTER THE END OF THE PERIOD </span></strong></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>After the end of the period, Beijer Ref completed the formation of 3D Plus, a joint venture with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Air Conditioning Europe Ltd, and a new organisation has been appointed for sales in the UK and Ireland. Beijer Ref has a holding of 67 per cent in 3D Plus.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><span>RISK DESCRIPTION</span></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>The Beijer Ref Group&rsquo;s operations are subject to a number of business environment factors, the effects of which on the Group&rsquo;s operating profit can be controlled to varying degrees. The Group&rsquo;s operations depend on general economic trends, primarily in Europe, which determine demand for Beijer Ref&rsquo;s products and services. Acquisitions are normally associated with risks, for example staff departures. Other operating risks, such as agency and supplier agreements, product liability and delivery commitments, technical development, warranties, dependence on key individuals, etc., are analysed continually. Where necessary, measures are taken to reduce the Group&rsquo;s risk exposure. In its operations, Beijer Ref is subject to financial risks such as currency risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk. The Parent&rsquo;s risk profile is the same as that of the Group. For further information, see the Group&rsquo;s Annual Report.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><span>ACCOUNTING POLICIES</span></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>This interim report was prepared in accordance with IAS 34, the Swedish Annual Accounts Act and the Swedish Financial Reporting Board&rsquo;s recommendation RFR 2 &lsquo;Accounting for legal entities&rsquo;. Beijer Ref continues to apply the same accounting policies and valuation methods as those described in the most recent annual report. For more information on accounting policies and future standards applied as from 1 January 2018, see note 2 of the 2017 Annual Report.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 14pt"><strong>A good start to the year.</strong></span></p><p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Net sales for the first quarter of 2018 increased by 18 per cent compared with the corresponding period in the previous year and amounted to SEK 2,605M (2,218).</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>The operating profit for the first quarter of 2018 amounted to SEK 172M (107), an increase of 61% compared with the same period last year.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>The profit for the period amounted to SEK 121M (72).</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Profit per share amounted to SEK 2.77 (1.63).</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>The acquisition of Tecsa (Pty) Ltd in South Africa is included in the company&rsquo;s accounts as of 1 March 2018.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Beijer Ref has been granted exclusive rights to distribute Mitsubishi Heavy Industries&rsquo; HVAC products in the UK, as well as the distribution rights in Ireland. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>During the quarter, Beijer Ref signed an agreement to acquire Heatcraft Australia Pty Ltd. The takeover is expected to take place at the beginning of May 2018.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Comments by the CEO</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><span>A strong first quarter.</span></strong></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>A good start to the year. That is how the first quarter of 2018 can be summarised. All regions report a double-digit increase in net sales, and the result is our best-ever first quarter. Net sales increased by a total of 18 per cent compared with the corresponding period last year. Organic growth reached almost 13 per cent. At the same time, the profit increased by 69 per cent, a record in our company&rsquo;s history. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>All of our regions except Africa report a double-digit increase in profits compared with the same quarter last year. Africa is still feeling the effects of the weak economic situation, although there are some signs that the market is recovering. Northern, Central and Eastern Europe report profit increases of more than 100 per cent. The shift now under way to sustainable refrigeration and freezer solutions is particularly distinctive in these areas. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>This trend can be explained by various factors. One is the strong economy. Even if our products are very much related to food products and therefore relatively insensitive to economic fluctuations, a positive market does of course contribute to our growth. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Another one is the F-Gas Regulation in Europe, which means a gradual phasing out of existing refrigerants, known as fluorinated gases. This Regulation extends until 2030 and is having increasingly noticeable effects on the market. Actors that use refrigeration and freezer systems must plan for a technology shift in which the new technology is based on eco-friendlier alternatives. Beijer Ref is in a good position to provide customers with sustainable solutions, which puts the Group in a favourable position in the market. Only a small part of the market has converted to the new technology. It is therefore our assessment that we have only seen the beginning of the transition.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>The quarter also saw a company acquisition, which is a feature of our growth strategy. The fact that in March we were able to conclude an agreement to acquire Heatcraft, one of Australia&rsquo;s biggest refrigeration wholesalers, which also has a manufacturing unit in China, gives us good opportunities to grow in the Asia Pacific region. The acquisition of the refrigeration wholesaler TecsaReco in South Africa, which we completed at the end of last year, was formally approved during the first quarter and consolidated into our books as of March. It is also pleasing that we have been granted exclusive distribution rights to Mitsubishi Heavy Industries&rsquo; HVAC products in the UK, as well as distribution rights in Ireland. Following these acquisitions, the European market will comprise 70 per cent of Beijer Ref&rsquo;s net sales, while Asia Pacific will account for 20 per cent and Africa for 10 per cent.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Our initiative in the field of OEM manufacturing, primarily of eco-friendly refrigeration systems and condensers, continues according to the agreed plan. We want to pursue innovation and develop new products. Last year we launched a new condenser, CUBO2 Smart, which is an alternative for both refrigeration and freezer installations. Sales are now starting to take off, and I believe that we have designed a high-volume product of the future, which is pleasing. In total, the OEM segment reported growth of around 21 per cent compared with the same period last year. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>In recent years we have been methodically expanding our OEM activities under the brand name SCM Ref. This is now established in all of our regions. Building an international platform for our eco-friendly technology is of major strategic importance and something on which we will continue to focus. We are well-positioned if F-gas regulations corresponding to the European one come into force outside Europe. On the same subject, we recently inaugurated a unique training centre &ndash; Beijer Ref Academy &ndash; near Padua in Italy. It is focused entirely on natural refrigerants and is equipped with the very latest in green technology. We will be inviting both customers and our own employees there in order to study and learn about this important area within our industry. This initiative is our way of showing how seriously we view environmental issues, and I hope that the centre will contribute to increased knowledge in the market in general. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>We are growing strongly and have a sense of cohesion in the Group that contributes to our positive development. Thanks to our engaged employees, we can continue to aim even higher.</span></p>

<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>CEO &amp; President</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>First quarter of 2018</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><span>NET SALES</span></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Beijer Ref increased its net sales by 18 per cent to SEK 2,605 million (2,218) in the first quarter of 2018. A favourable economic situation and price rises, especially in refrigerants, have resulted in continued strong growth in demand in our key European markets. All regions report a double-digit increase in net sales in the first quarter. Adjusted for exchange rate changes and acquisitions, organic growth in net sales was 13 per cent.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><span>PROFIT</span></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>The Group&rsquo;s operating profit totalled SEK 172 million (107) during the fourth quarter, an increase of 61 per cent. The phasing-out of refrigerants has resulted in price rises, which combined with continued healthy growth in HVAC and OEM had a positive impact on the profit in the period. Adjusted for exchange rate changes and acquisitions, the organic improvement in the operating profit was 56 per cent.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><span>CASH FLOW</span></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Cash flow from operating activities before change in working capital was SEK 153 million during the first quarter of 2018 compared with SEK 95 million for 2017, primarily due to the improved profit. Working capital increased during the first quarter by SEK 112 million, compared with a fall in working capital of SEK 88 the previous year. This produces cash flow from operating activities of SEK 41 million, compared with SEK 183 million the previous year. The change in working capital between the years is primarily due to the fact that working capital at the beginning of 2017 was at a higher than normal level, combined with a build-up of refrigerant stocks.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><span>INVESTMENTS</span></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>The Group&rsquo;s investments in fixed assets including business combinations totalled SEK 349 million (21) during the first quarter and relate primarily to the acquisition of the shares in TecsaReco.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><span>SIGNIFICANT EVENTS DURING THE QUARTER</span></strong><span> </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>The company&rsquo;s acquisition of TecsaReco, a wholesaler based in South Africa that offers a wide range of products and brands in commercial and comfort refrigeration, air conditioning and spare parts for white goods, is consolidated into the company&rsquo;s accounts as of 1 March 2018, after the competition authorities in South Africa, Botswana and Namibia gave their approval. Total consideration for the acquired operation in Tecsa amounted to SEK 298 million. The acquired net assets, which mainly consist of stock and operating receivables and liabilities, amounted to SEK 145 million and give a surplus value of SEK 153 million. The surplus value relates to goodwill and other intangibles. Total yearly sales in Tecsa amounts to appr SEK 450 million. The business have around 300 employees and 23 branches. The acquisition has affected the Group&rsquo;s net sales by SEK 40 million during the <br /> quarter.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>In March 2018 a joint venture was formed between Beijer Ref AB and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Air-Conditioning Europe, Ltd (MHIAE). Beijer Ref has been granted exclusive rights to distribute Mitsubishi Heavy Industries&rsquo; range of air conditioning and heat pumps in the UK, as well as distribution rights in Ireland.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>During the quarter, Beijer Ref signed an agreement to acquire Heatcraft Australia Pty Ltd. The company has just over 300 employees and net sales in 2017 totalled approximately SEK 1.1 billion. Sales take place through a large distribution network with more than 65 branches. This transaction sees Beijer Ref doubling its net sales in the Asia Pacific region. The acquisition also includes an operation in Singapore and a manufacturing unit in China.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><span>RISK DESCRIPTION</span></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>The Beijer Ref Group&rsquo;s operations are subject to a number of business environment factors, the effects of which on the Group&rsquo;s operating profit can be controlled to varying degrees. The Group&rsquo;s operations depend on general economic trends, primarily in Europe, which determine demand for Beijer Ref&rsquo;s products and services. Acquisitions are normally associated with risks, for example staff departures. Other operating risks, such as agency and supplier agreements, product liability and delivery commitments, technical development, warranties, dependence on key individuals, etc., are analysed continually. Where necessary, measures are taken to reduce the Group&rsquo;s risk exposure. In its operations, Beijer Ref is subject to financial risks such as currency risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk. The Parent&rsquo;s risk profile is the same as that of the Group. For further information, see the Group&rsquo;s Annual Report.</span></p>

<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>In addition to wholesale operations, Heatcraft has a manufacturing unit in Wuxi, China, where heat exchangers and cooling units are produced. The deal also includes just over 5 percent of the shares in the public company Kulthorn Kirby, a Thai compressor manufacturer.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Heatcraft's headquarters are located in Sydney. The company employs more than 300 employees and sales in 2017 amounted to approximately SEK 1.1 billion. The company has relatively limited profitability. The business will initially be continued in its existing form and under the brand Heatcraft.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Beijer Ref acquires Heatcraft from Lennox International for a purchase consideration of SEK 450 million excluding operations in New Zealand. For competition law reasons, Beijer Ref has chosen to divest the New Zealand operations of Heatcraft simultaneously with completion of the transaction.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>With the acquisition of Heatcraft, Beijer Ref becomes a significantly stronger player in Australia. For Beijer Refs region Asia Pacific, total annual sales will amount to over SEK 2.2 billion yearly after completion, which represents 19 percent of Beijer Ref's global sales, compared with 10 percent today.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Per Bertland, CEO of Beijer Ref, comments:</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>&ldquo;This acquisition is in line with our strategy to also grow outside Europe. In addition, we strengthen the OEM segment through the acquisition of the Wuxi production plant in China, which in the long term could provide further opportunities to continue expanding our European green technology to the rest of the world to a much greater extent. We expect that, Australia in particular, will comply with the European directives to phase out environmentally hazardous refrigerants. With the acquisition of Heatcraft, we are even better positioned in the market for green technology which we believe will grow significantly.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>The parties have reached a binding agreement as of today and completion is scheduled for April 2018. The transaction is conditional on a pre-completion restructure of Heatcraft. The acquisition is expected to have positive effects on both sales and earnings in the long term.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Beijer Ref was advised by Oaktower Partnership, Ashurst and Deloitte. </span></p>

<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif">Beijer Ref is the majority owner of the joint venture, which will be named 3D Plus Limited (3D Plus). The joint venture is an outcome of Beijer Ref&rsquo;s strategy to work closely with its main suppliers. Besides getting exclusive rights to distribute Mitsubishi Heavy Industries&rsquo; (MHI) air conditioning and heat pumps in the UK, Beijer Ref will be one of the main providers of the products in Ireland.</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Per Bertland, CEO of Beijer Ref AB, commented:</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>&ldquo;The UK and Ireland markets are important to us and we continuously look at different ways of growing our market share with key partners.

<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>3D Plus will be developed over time into a market leading brand for the sale and distribution of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries&rsquo; products.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Masayuki Fujinami, Managing Director of MHIAE, commented:<br /> &ldquo;MHIAE and Beijer Ref have had a successful relationship collaborating in the Scandinavian market for many years. Through the formation of this joint venture, we are happy to be moving beyond a traditional manufacturer and distributor relationship and to joining our two companies together in a way that will allow us to harness our respective expertise and experience jointly. MHIAE regards 3D Plus as a symbol of this integration and it will receive the full support of the MHI Group.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>&ldquo;It is our intention that 3D Plus will quickly become a similar size business to other Beijer Ref distribution channels in the UK. The MHI brand already has a strong market position which is a great platform for future growth.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="ingress">In times of challenge, we are supporting our customers. As covid-19 has impacted numerous industries worldwide, Beijer Ref is determined to keep its business running as much as possible.</div>
A significant part of our end customer base consists of supermarkets and food retailers. As society as a whole, now more than ever relies on them serving us with essentials, they must be provided with refrigeration technique, products, and components to be able to run their businesses without any disruptions.

Today, Beijer Ref has more than 400 branches in Europe, Africa, and Asia Pacific. Our ambition is to keep as many of them open as possible, fully stocked with products. Added to that, we have made efforts to increase our level of e-commerce, and we have expanded our delivery service.

Our OEM site in Wuxi, China, has been running as usual since a month back. Our site in Italy is also open and is delivering products to our European branches.

Naturally, Beijer Ref takes all precautions necessary to stop spreading the covid-19 virus with increased hygiene and cleaning measures at our sites and branches. The safety of our employees is our top priority, and we carefully monitor the regulations in each local market.

This is a time for commitment and standing united as a whole. I am proud of the fighting spirit of the entire staff at Beijer Ref. We will keep doing our utmost to be a reliable partner to our customers, suppliers and end-users.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="ingress">In order to meet the market demand for refrigeration based on natural refrigerants, the production capacity of the subsidiary SCM Frigo is being expanded with a new plant.</div>
SCM Frigo S.p.a, based outside Padua, Italy, is one of Beijer Ref's fastest growing subsidiaries. The company develops refrigeration systems based on the environmentally friendly refrigerant CO2. SCM Frigo is one of the global leaders in the market.

Demand for environmentally friendly refrigeration is driven by the European F-gas regulation and a general green trend. The regulation means that F-gases, which are the most important refrigerant for industrial and commercial refrigeration, will be reduced by 80 percent by 2030. The current production capacity for SCM Frigo therefore needs to be expanded.

Beijer Ref is investing in a new facility of approximately 13,000 m2 which will contain production, storage and space for the Beijer Ref Academy training center. Construction will begin in the fall of 2019 and the plant is expected to be completed by the end of the fourth quarter of 2020. The investment is expected to amount to approximately € 10M. The plant will have a green profile.

CEO Per Bertland comments:
<em>Due to the European F-gas regulation, we expect the market for environmentally friendly refrigeration systems to continue to be strong over the next five to ten years. The transition to green technology has just begun and so far, an estimated 15-20 percent of retailers in Europe have converted to chillers that are adapted to the new regulation. With the new plant, we ensure that Beijer Ref can meet the increased demand of the market.</em>]]></content:encoded>

Both companies already have extensive cooperation in Europe, Asia and Africa. For the first time, an agreement has now been entered for a collaboration in the Australian and New Zealand markets - a partnership that strengthens both companies' global growth and presence.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="color:#00043e"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">BITZER is a compressor manufacturer located worldwide with products and services for cooling, air conditioning and process cooling as well as transport.

The Group is present in 36 countries with more than 450 branches, whereof 100 are located in Australia and New Zealand.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="color:#00043e"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">The new agreement means that from now on, Beijer Ref will provide a complete range of BITZER's product portfolio in Australia and New Zealand.</span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="color:#00043e"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Per Bertland, CEO Beijer Ref, comments:</span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="color:#00043e"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">“We have long experience of working with BITZER and it is a natural step for us to develop our offering in important and growing markets such as Australia and New Zealand. Particularly interesting is that BITZER has one of the most developed product portfolios. They are also in the forefront when it comes to providing high technology solutions based on natural refrigerants. Beijer Ref always strives to expand its sustainable range, and together with our own OEM program we can now offer our customers complete solutions that are long lasting for the future.”</span></span></span></p>

Beijer Ref has an expressed mission – to provide the market with global expertise in refrigeration and air conditioning. By growing more quickly than the market, the goal is to strengthen the position as a world-leading organisation. To do this, the group works according to a strategy that is divided into five focus areas – acquisition, OEM, purchasing &amp; logistics, digitalisation and sustainability. A prerequisite for the successful implementation of Beijer Ref’s business strategy and safeguarding of its long-term interests, including its sustainability, is that the company is able to recruit and retain qualified personnel. The objective of Beijer Ref’s remuneration policy for senior executives is therefore to offer competitive remuneration on market terms, in order to attract, motivate and retain competent and skilled employees. These guidelines enable the company to offer senior executives a competitive total remuneration.

<p><span><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Net sales increased by 1.3% in the first quarter compared to the same period last year and amounted to SEK 3,478 million (3,434). Acquisition effects amounted to 3.3%. Positive currency effects amounted to 1.2%, while organic growth was negative by -3.2%.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">The operating profit for the quarter amounted to SEK 197 million (244), a decrease of 19% compared with the same period last year. The operating margin amounted to 5.7% (7.1%). The main reasons for this are the effects of Covid-19 and a lower share of refrigerant sales. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Profit before tax was SEK 182 million (228). Net financial items are in line with previous years despite increased borrowing in connection with the acquisition of ACD Trade.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Profit per share before and after dilution amounted to SEK 1.05 (1.33 and 1.32 respectively), a decrease of 21%.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">The acquisition of the wholesale company ACD Trade in Australia was completed in the first quarter of 2020. The company has annual sales of SEK 540 million with 60 employees across 9 branches. The company is included in the consolidated accounts with effect from 1 February 2020.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">The company's liquidity remained good during the quarter and the company's balance sheet is strong, with unutilised credits amounting to SEK 1,272million (1,588).</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">The second quarter will be affected by the effects of Covid-19. Measures have been taken in all parts of the business to fend off some of the effects. The action programme will have an effect in the second quarter and the company expects net savings of approximately SEK 250 million in 2020.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Due to the present uncertainty about the effects of Covid-19, the board has decided to postpone the Annual General Meeting and proposes that the dividend is halved to SEK 1.75. The new date for the Annual General Meeting is 25 June 2020.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p align="left" style="text-align:left"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:#284561"><span style="font-size:16pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Comments by the CEO</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><strong><span style="font-size:14pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">We shall come out of this crisis stronger</span></span></span></strong></span></span></p>

<p><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">The first quarter of the year had a strong start before the Covid-19 pandemic made an impact on the global economy. It is a scenario that we could not have foreseen, but which is nonetheless a reality to which we must relate. As soon as we realised the extent of the situation, necessary measures were taken to address these new market conditions. Our strong cohesion that characterises the group plays an especially important role now, because such rapid changes require teamwork and loyalty from our employees. They are our greatest asset and their safety and well-being will always be of the highest priority.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Sales in the first two months of the quarter followed our expectations until the effects of Covid-19 became felt in the second half of March. Overall, net sales including acquisitions are slightly higher than in the same period last year.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">The operating margin for the quarter has been negatively affected and two factors in particular have had an effect. Refrigerant prices have continued to fall and are at a lower level than in the previous year. However, we are beginning to sense some stabilisation of this trend and in historical terms prices are still at a high level. The effect of Covid-19 has obviously also had an impact, with most of the largest markets, which together make up about 70% of sales, being almost completely shut down during part of March. Nevertheless, sales of air conditioning have been relatively strong during the quarter, especially in Central Europe, Eastern Europe and Asia Pacific. Our HVAC product area has thus experienced growth during the quarter, including the effects of the acquisition of ACD Trade in Australia at the beginning of the year. In the OEM business we see a slight increase in sales during the quarter, despite the fact that our factories in China and Italy had to close for a short period in February and March respectively. Since Beijer Ref's business is considered to be essential to society – our products are necessary for the proper functioning of the food industry – most of our 450 branches are open in order to provide service and maintenance, in some cases in very restrictive forms. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Our assessment is that the effects of Covid-19 will have an even greater impact on the business in the second quarter. For this reason, we have taken measures in the form of cost savings. Examples of such measures are that management and most employees have voluntarily reduced their salaries. A large proportion of our employees have temporarily reduced working hours, the number of employees has been reduced and major investment projects have been temporarily paused. We have also negotiated improved terms with our suppliers. All in all, our cost base has been reduced in both the short and long term, while we will be able to gear up quickly again when the market turns up. We hope and believe that the third quarter will be more stable and that the market will return to a more normalised state by the end of the year. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Historically, Beijer Ref has come out stronger after a crisis. We are part of an industry that is important to society, which means that the business does not come to a stop despite the fact that we are in an extreme situation. In circumstances such as these, there may be acquisition opportunities that would otherwise not have been possible. Our e-commerce has increased significantly during this period, which gives us a clear indication that our initiatives in digitalisation have been well worth the investment costs and here we will of course continue to invest for the future. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Beijer Ref has always been and will remain a company that stands for stability, in both good and bad times. Due to the present Covid-19 crisis, the board has proposed halving the dividend and postponing the Annual General Meeting until the end of June. The group's strong balance sheet and cash flow provide us with security even in the present circumstances and we are determined to learn lessons from what we are going through now, in order to be even better in the future. 2020 will be challenging, but we see a bright future and will be strong on the day things turn.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:9pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Beijer Ref increased its net sales by 1.3 per cent to SEK 3,478 million (3,434) in the first quarter of 2020. Adjusted for exchange rate changes and acquisitions, organic growth in net sales was negative at -3.2 per cent (7.8).</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:9pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">The main reasons are falling refrigerant prices and the effect of Covid-19, with most of the largest markets, which together make up about 70% of sales, being almost completely shut down during part of March. The company estimates that sales have decreased by approx. SEK 200 million as a result of Covid-19. A weakened Swedish krona resulted in positive currency effects of SEK 41 million (104), corresponding to 1.2 per cent (4.3), since most of the company’s sales are in currencies other than Swedish kronor.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><strong><span style="font-size:9pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">PROFIT</span></span></span></strong></span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:9pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">The group’s operating profit totalled SEK 197 million (244) during the first quarter, which is a decrease of 19 per cent. Positive exchange rate effects of SEK 3 million (8) are included in the operating profit figures. The operating margin amounted to 5.7 per cent (7.1).</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:9pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">The reduction in profit is due to lower prices of refrigerants, a shift in the mix to a higher proportion of air conditioning and the effects of Covid-19. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:9pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Profit before tax was SEK 182 million (228).

<p><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:9pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Cash flow from current operations before changes in working capital amounted to SEK 218 million in 2020, compared with SEK 278 million in 2019. The change is due to lower earnings during the quarter and a higher proportion of tax paid.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:9pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Working capital increased by SEK 21 million during the quarter compared with SEK 42 million the previous year. This gives cash flow from current operations of SEK 197 million (236). The change in working capital between the years is due primarily to a smaller build-up of stocks during the quarter.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

At the beginning of 2020, macroeconomic conditions were relatively good, although a slight slowdown could be observed. However, the spread of the Covid-19 virus changed the situation drastically and the market reacted with sharp stock market falls and lower interest rates. So far, the consequences have been significant and it is too early at present to assess the overall effects the outbreak will have on Beijer Ref. From mid-March onwards, markets representing 70% of the company's operations have been closed. In China, which was the first out, production is in full swing and demand is increasing. The factory in Italy is also open from 6 April and has a good stock of orders. The company estimates that sales have decreased by approx. SEK 200 million as a result of Covid-19. Measures have been taken to address the effects, including in the following areas:</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:9pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">• Adjusted purchasing and inventory build-up, as well as extended credit periods</span></span></span></span></span></p>

The Board of Directors of Beijer Ref will propose to the general meeting on April 16 a dividend of SEK 1.75, while also maintaining its ambition of a total dividend of SEK 3.50 in 2020.</span></span></span></span></span></span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="vertical-align:middle"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black">The Board of Directors and CEO propose a cash dividend to shareholders of SEK 1,75 per share, which deviates from the previously communicated dividend amount of SEK 3,50. The adjustment of the dividend is caused by the current market instability. It is the Board’s ambition to summon the shareholders to an extraordinary general meeting later this year to resolve on an additional dividend, if, at such time, the market is stabilized, and visibility of earnings is normalized. The current market situation has caused the Board of the company, as well as other companies, to take precautionary measures and the Board therefore suggests this adaption compared to previously communicated dividend proposal.</span></span></span></span></span></span><br>

<br>

The deviation from what has previously been communicated regarding the intended dividend is caused by the current market instability. It is proposed that the record date for the dividend be 20 April 2020. If the Annual General Meeting decides to accept this proposal, the dividend will be paid from Euroclear on 23 April 2020.</span></span></span></span></span></span><br>

Beijer Ref has an expressed mission – to provide the market with global expertise in refrigeration and air conditioning. By growing more quickly than the market, the goal is to strengthen the position as a world-leading organisation. To do this, the group works according to a strategy that is divided into five focus areas – acquisition, OEM, purchasing &amp; logistics, digitalisation and sustainability. A prerequisite for the successful implementation of Beijer Ref’s business strategy and safeguarding of its long-term interests, including its sustainability, is that the company is able to recruit and retain qualified personnel. The objective of Beijer Ref’s remuneration policy for senior executives is therefore to offer competitive remuneration on market terms, in order to attract, motivate and retain competent and skilled employees. These guidelines enable the company to offer senior executives a competitive total remuneration. For more information regarding the company’s business strategy, please see the company’s website www.beijerref.com. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

To replace Chris Nelson, who is not standing for re-election, the Election Committee has deemed it desirable to supplement the Board of Directors with an international member with broad industry experience within HVAC (Heating, Ventilation and Air conditioning) and experience of sales and leadership. Gregory Alcorn was born in 1966.

<p><span style="line-height:120%"><strong><span style="font-size:14pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="color:#1e2736">Strong end to a good year</span></span></span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">2019 was yet another strong year for Beijer Ref. The group's net sales amounted to SEK 14.8 billion, an increase of almost 14% compared with the previous year. Organic growth for the year amounted to 4.4%. The operating margin was 8.3%, which is in line with previous years, despite the fact that both prices and volume of the refrigerants have gradually fallen during the year. Operating profit increased by 13.3% compared with the previous year.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">The fourth quarter began somewhat slowly, while the second half was significantly stronger. During the period, the group's sales and profit increased compared with the same quarter the previous year. Net sales increased by 4.3%. The increase in sales is mainly due to increased sales of HVAC and OEM. The operating margin was 7.4%, which is 0.5 percentage points better than the previous year. The period does not contain any acquisition effects.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Both the quarter and the year as a whole have been marked by a fall in the price level of refrigerants and a decrease in demand for refrigerants, which has had a negative impact on Beijer Ref's earnings. At the same time, HVAC and OEM have developed well during the quarter. Commercial cooling, apart from refrigerants, is stable and together with HVAC and OEM more than well compensates for the negative development of refrigerants. Nevertheless, it is reasonable to assume that refrigerant prices will be at a historically high level until 2030 when the phasing-out of F-gases under EU regulations will be completed. Meanwhile, Beijer Ref is well equipped to provide the market with environmentally friendly alternatives. Demand for such solutions is increasing and we act accordingly; among other things, we are doubling our OEM production capacity by investing in a new plant in Padua, Italy. We are also investing in our plant in Gothenburg to meet the increased demand for natural refrigerants such as CO<sub>2</sub> and propane. At the same time, we are expanding the group's educational academies, where we are increasing knowledge about natural refrigerants. During the year we have opened new academies in Europe and China, which is also a good way to build relationships with our customers and suppliers. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">All regions show sales growth in the fourth quarter, in particular Africa and Asia Pacific, which had peak season during the period. The acquisition of Tecsa Reco in South Africa has developed well and is now contributing to improving the group’s margins. In Australia, the restructuring of Kirby has gone according to plan, which has led to improved margins compared to the same period in the previous year. During the quarter, it became clear that our Australian operations will be coordinated under one headquarters and one distribution and logistics centre, an initiative that will provide synergies in an important market. Southern Europe has also had a positive increase in sales and profit during the quarter, which is mainly driven by demand for air conditioning. The Nordic region, Central Europe and Eastern Europe have been the most affected by lower refrigerant prices. However, the Nordic region remains our most profitable region, and it is also the most advanced in conversion to new environmental technologies. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Acquisitions are always high on our list of priorities. 2018 was an acquisition-intensive year and 2019 was largely devoted to consolidating the new companies into our group structure. It therefore feels good to start the new year with the acquisition of ACD Trade in Australia. A highly interesting company with annual sales of approximately SEK 540 million that distributes well-known HVAC brands. With a strong cash flow and a strong balance sheet behind us, we have every opportunity to continue to grow, both organically and through acquisitions. Together with cost control and a growing market in great need of our products, we are entering 2020 with confidence. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

All regions demonstrate an increase in sales. Both Australia and Africa show strong sales growth during the quarter, which offsets the Group's seasonal variations.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:9pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Commercial refrigeration represents 54% (56%) of the company's sales, 35% (33%) is HVAC and OEM accounts for 11% (11%) of total sales. The latter two show organic growth of approximately 7% and 6% respectively during the quarter. Refrigerants’ share of total business continues to decline. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:9pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">A weakened Swedish krona resulted in positive currency effects of SEK 111 million (117), corresponding to 3.4% (5.3%), since most of the company’s sales are in currencies other than Swedish kronor.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

The operating margin amounted to 7.4% (6.9%). Adjusted for IFRS 16 effects, the company's net financial items are SEK -6 million (-12), which is lower than the previous year in spite of increased borrowing.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:9pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Cash flow from current operations before changes in working capital amounted to SEK 1,280 million in 2019, compared with SEK 949 million in 2018. Operating profit is higher in the quarter, but non-cash items increased by SEK 297 million in respect of depreciation of usage rights assets due to the transition to IFRS 16. Tax paid during the quarter is also higher, due to higher profits. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:9pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Working capital increased by SEK 231 million during the quarter, compared with a decrease of SEK 326 million the previous year. This gives a positive cash flow from operating activities of SEK 481 million, compared with SEK 447 million the previous year. The change in working capital between the years is mainly explained by a lower build-up of stocks. The company has not extended SEK 150 million for the certificate programme, which was launched at the end of 2018.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Net sales increased by 9,6% in the third quarter compared to the same period last year and amounted to SEK 3,953 million (3,607). Organic growth was 5.2%.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">The operating profit for the quarter amounted to SEK 358 million (339), an increase of 5.5% compared with the same period last year. The operating margin was 9.1% (9.4%), of which 0.2% is a positive IFRS 16 effect.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Profit for the period totalled SEK 256 million (240). Profit per share amounted to SEK 2.00 (1.88).</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">The company's liquidity is good and unutilised credit amounts to SEK 1,453 million (589).</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">With effect from 1 January 2019, the company applies IFRS 16 with regard to the group's leasing agreements and all figures for 2019 include this change. The conversion had a positive effect of SEK 7 million on operating profit and of SEK 0.5 million on net profit.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p align="left" style="text-align:left"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-size:16pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="color:#1e2736">Comments by the CEO</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="line-height:120%"><strong><span style="font-size:14pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="color:#1e2736">Sustainable growth</span></span></span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">During the third quarter, the group's sales and profit increased compared with the same period the previous year. Net sales amounted to SEK 3,953 million (SEK 3,607 million), which is an increase of 9.6%, of which 5.2% is organic. The increase in sales is mainly due to increased sales of HVAC and OEM.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Operating profit during the quarter amounted to SEK 358 million (SEK 339 million) and the operating margin was 9.1% (9.4%). The margin is slightly lower than the previous year. The main reason is a continuing downward price trend for refrigerants. Our assessment has always been that the price level will become stabilised, something that we have not yet seen. In the long run, the phasing-out programme under the European F-gas regulation, which runs until 2030, should mean a price increase for refrigerants. There are also tougher measures to prevent the illegal trade in refrigerants, something about which we take a positive view. The percentage of refrigerants in total sales is falling and is expected to continue to decrease.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Of the group's other product segments, corresponding to approximately 90% of the total business, sales in HVAC now account for 38% (34%) of the company's turnover. The company's OEM product range also continues to increase its share of sales and now accounts for approximately 10% (9%). To be able to satisfy the market's growing demand for environmentally friendly refrigeration technology, Beijer Ref has decided to invest in a new production facility for OEM manufacturing in Padua, Italy.&nbsp; As well as production and storage, the building will accommodate offices and a training and development centre for natural refrigerants. The facility is expected to be ready by the end of 2020. We will also invest in a production line to handle natural, environmentally friendly refrigerants such as CO2 and propane at the company's filling unit in Gothenburg. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">All regions except the Nordic region show growth in both sales and profit. If we look at our geographical regions, the outcome is affected to some extent by seasonal variations. It is gratifying that both Asia Pacific and Africa are showing profit improvements. In Asia Pacific, we have also implemented a number of measures that have contributed to both sales growth and better margins. In Africa, we have received new orders for green, environmentally friendly technology.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">The market's interest in our environmentally friendly refrigeration technology continues to increase, for which reason we are educating customers, suppliers and our own personnel in handling natural refrigerants. Our training concept Beijer Ref Academy, which is concentrating on exactly this, is highly appreciated. Our first academy was inaugurated about a year ago in Italy. Now we have established further academies in France and China and more are in the pipeline. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Beijer Ref has grown to be active today in 36 countries. Although the companies work independently, we also work as a group with common basic values and centralised projects. To contribute to development and increase knowledge, we have launched the Beijer Ref Exchange Programme during the quarter. Employees from different parts of Beijer Ref have the opportunity to try a new job at another company within the group. I am convinced that this type of activity strengthens us as a group and helps to increase motivation and team spirit and provides us with new insights. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">My assessment is that we have good opportunities for continued growth, despite uncertain external factors. Acquisitions are an important part of the strategy and are evaluated continuously. The company's liquidity is good and the group has a strong cash flow, which means that we have the capacity to perform further acquisitions. Overall, we have coped very well with the conditions prevailing in the market. Our strategy is firmly anchored within the company, which puts us in a strong position for the future.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:9pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Beijer Ref increased its net sales by 9.6 per cent to SEK 3,953 million (3,607) in the third quarter of 2019, 1.7% of which is explained by the acquisitions made in 2018. Adjusted for exchange rate changes and acquisitions, organic growth in net sales was 5.2 per cent. All regions except the Nordics show sales growth. Commercial refrigeration represents 52% (57%) of the company's sales, 38% (34%) is HVAC and OEM accounts for 10% (9%) of total sales. The latter two show organic growth of 18% and 14% respectively during the quarter. Refrigerants continue to decrease and represent 12% (14%) of total sales.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:9pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">A weakened Swedish krona resulted in positive currency effects of SEK 91 million (195), corresponding to 2.7% (8.8%), since most of the company’s sales are in currencies other than Swedish kronor.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

The operating margin was 9.1% (9.4%), for which the main explanation is lower prices for refrigerants. Adjusted for IFRS 16 effects, the company's net financial items are in principle unchanged compared with the previous year despite increased borrowing.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:9pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">The pre-tax profit was SEK 344 million (331). Profit for the period was SEK 256 million (240). Profit per share amounted to SEK 2.00 (1.88).</span></span></span></span></span></p>

Operating profit is higher in the quarter, but non-cash items increased by SEK 76 million in respect of depreciation of usage rights assets due to the transition to IFRS 16. Taxes paid during the quarter are higher, which explains the decrease.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:9pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Working capital decreased by SEK 212 million during the quarter compared with an increase of SEK 198 million the previous year. This gives a positive cash flow from operating activities of SEK 583 million, compared with SEK 191 million the previous year. The change in working capital between the years is mainly explained by a lower build-up of stocks. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:9pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">At the end of the period, the group had unutilised credit facilities totalling SEK 1,453 million (589).</span></span></span></span></span></p>

Production capacity is therefore increased at the subsidiary SCM Frigo S.p.a., outside Padua in Italy, one of Beijer Ref's fastest growing subsidiaries. The company develops refrigeration units that are based on the environmentally friendly refrigerant CO2. SCM Frigo is one of the global leaders in the market. Demand for environmentally friendly refrigeration units is driven by the European F-gas regulation and a general green trend. The regulation means that F-gases, which are the most important refrigerants for industrial and commercial cooling, must be reduced by 80% by 2030. Construction begins in the autumn of 2019 and the plant will be completed at the end of the fourth quarter of 2020. The investment is estimated to amount to approximately 10 million euros. </span></span></span><span style="font-size:9pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">The facility will have a clear green profile.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

The Group’s operations depend on general economic trends, primarily in Europe, which determine demand for Beijer Ref’s products and services. Acquisitions are normally associated with risks, for example loss of key employees. Other operating risks, such as agency and supplier agreements, product liability and delivery commitments, technical development, warranties, dependence on key individuals, etc., are analysed continually. Where necessary, measures are taken to reduce the Group’s risk exposure. In its operations, Beijer Ref is subject to financial risks such as currency risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk. The Parent’s risk profile is the same as that of the Group. For further information, see the Group’s Annual Report.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

Right of use agreements of less than 12 months are reported as short-term agreements and are therefore not included in the reported liabilities or rights of use.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">In order to meet the market demand for refrigeration based on natural refrigerants, the production capacity of the subsidiary SCM Frigo is being expanded with a new plant.</span></span></strong></p><p align="center" style="text-align:center">&nbsp;</p>

<p><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">SCM Frigo S.p.a, based outside Padua, Italy, is one of Beijer Ref's fastest growing subsidiaries. The company develops refrigeration systems based on the environmentally friendly refrigerant CO<sub>2</sub>. SCM Frigo is one of the global leaders in the market.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Demand for environmentally friendly refrigeration is driven by the European F-gas regulation and a general green trend. The regulation means that F-gases, which are the most important refrigerant for industrial and commercial refrigeration, will be reduced by 80 percent by 2030. The current production capacity for SCM Frigo therefore needs to be expanded.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Beijer Ref is investing in a new facility of approximately 13,000 m2 which will contain production, storage and space for the Beijer Ref Academy training center. Construction will begin in the fall of 2019 and the plant is expected to be completed by the end of the fourth quarter of 2020. The investment is expected to amount to approximately € 10M. The plant will have a green profile.</span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">CEO Per Bertland comments:</span></span></p>

<p><span style="color:#023450"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Due to the European F-gas regulation, we expect the market for environmentally friendly refrigeration systems to continue to be strong over the next five to ten years. The transition to green technology has just begun and so far, an estimated 15-20 percent of retailers in Europe have converted to chillers that are adapted to the new regulation. With the new plant, we ensure that Beijer Ref can meet the increased demand of the market.</span></span></span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 14pt"><strong><strong>Continued strong growth</strong></strong></span></p><p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Net sales increased by 14% in the second quarter compared to the same period last year and amounted to SEK 3,996 million (3,510). Organic growth was 4.4%.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>The operating profit for the quarter amounted to SEK 373 million (345), an increase of 8% compared with the same period last year. The operating margin was 9.3% (9.8%), of which 0.2% is a positive IFRS 16 effect.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Profit for the period totalled SEK 265 million (255). Profit per share amounted to SEK 2.08 (1.98).</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>The company's liquidity is good and unutilised credit amounts to SEK 1427 million (393).</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>With effect from 1 January 2019, the company applies IFRS 16 with regard to the group's leasing </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>agreements and all figures for 2019 include this change. The conversion affected operating profit </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>positively by SEK 7 million and net profit by SEK 0.1 million. The equity ratio has decreased by 3.3 percentage points as a result of an increased balance sheet total.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Comments by the CEO</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><span>Environmentally-friendly refrigeration technology </span></strong></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><span>and air conditioning drive growth</span></strong></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>The market during the quarter was characterised by continuing strong demand and both sales and profit increased, both organically and through acquisitions. In total, net sales amounted to SEK 3,996 million (3,510), an increase of 14% of which 7% is acquired sales and more than 4% is organic growth. The operating margin, including the effect of IFRS 16, amounted to 9.3% (9.8%). The margin is slightly lower than in the previous year, mainly due to the price of refrigerants not being at the same high level as in 2018.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>One of the main features of the quarter is that our OEM and HVAC segments are moving forward strongly, especially in Europe. Both segments are driven by the EU's phasing-out programme for HFC gases, which are being gradually replaced by environmentally friendly alternatives. The OEM segment grew in total by 32% during the quarter and accounted for 10% of the group's sales. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>The warm summers of recent years in Europe have contributed to an increased interest in heat pumps, since these are also used for air conditioning. This, combined with a generally high demand, contributes to the strong development of the HVAC segment. Long-term partnerships with strong brands, such as Toshiba, Carrier and Mitsubishi Heavy Industries, give us a good market position. In total, sales in HVAC increased by 37% and now represent 41% of the group's sales.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>The quarter has tough comparative figures, since 2018 was a year when the price of refrigerants was at a historically high level. From autumn 2018 and during the first half of 2019, prices have gradually fallen, which affects the commercial refrigeration segment negatively, although volume sales did not decline at the same rate. The decline in sales is well offset by the growth of other segments, which means that the importance for the group of the price trend for refrigerants is declining. The assessment is that the price of refrigerants will stabilise during the autumn. The phasing-out period runs until 2030, with the next major reduction in import quotas in 2021. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>All of our geographical regions show growth apart from Eastern Europe, which has been most affected by the price trend for refrigerants. It is positive that the African market is showing growth after having previously been in recession, and we see potential for continuing improvement in earnings.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>In general, we can see how more and more countries outside Europe are committing to resolutions that involve phasing out HFC gases. Recently, for example, Cuba became the 73rd country to sign the Kigali agreement and more are being added on an ongoing basis. The agreement means that the consumption of HFC gases is to be reduced by more than 80% over the next 30 years. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>During the autumn, we will start a project to expand our production capacity in OEM in order to better meet the increasing demand for eco-friendly refrigeration technology. We will also invest in our own production line, which will handle natural, environmentally friendly refrigerants at the company's filling unit in Gothenburg. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Our market is growing globally and we have much left to do. The group's liquidity is good, which opens up opportunities for new acquisitions. Overall, we are entering the third quarter in excellent shape.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><span>Per Bertland</span></strong><span>, CEO</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Second quarter of 2019</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><span>NET SALES</span></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Beijer Ref increased its net sales by 14 per cent to SEK 3,996 million (3,510) in the second quarter of 2019, 7% of which is explained by the acquisitions made in 2018. Adjusted for exchange rate changes and acquisitions, organic growth in net sales was 4.4 per cent. All regions except Eastern Europe show sales growth. Commercial refrigeration represents 49% of the company's sales, 41% is air conditioning and OEM accounts for 10% of total sales. The latter two show a 20% increase in sales during the quarter, while dependence on refrigerants has decreased.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>A weakened Swedish krona resulted in positive currency effects of SEK 85 million (133), corresponding to 2.6% (5.8), since most of the company&rsquo;s sales are in currencies other than Swedish kronor.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><span>PROFIT</span></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>The group&rsquo;s operating profit totalled SEK 373 million (345) during the second quarter, an increase of 8 per cent. The operating margin was 9.3% (9.8%), the main explanation for which is lower prices for refrigerants and that companies acquired during 2018 have a slightly lower margin. Adjusted for IFRS 16 effect, the company's net financial items are in principle unchanged compared with the previous year despite increased borrowing.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>The pre-tax profit was SEK 359 million (342). Profit for the period was SEK 265 million (255). Profit per share amounted to SEK 2.08 (1.98).</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><span>CASH FLOW</span></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Cash flow from current operations before changes in working capital amounted to SEK 381 million in 2019, compared with SEK 286 million in 2018. The increase is due to improved profits during the quarter and a positive effect of SEK 74 million attributable to depreciation of usage rights assets arising from the transition to IFRS 16 (leasing). The corresponding amount of SEK 74 m is reported as a decrease in financing activities.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Working capital increased by SEK 426 million during the quarter compared with SEK 275 million the previous year. This gives cash flow from operating activities of SEK -45 million, compared with SEK 11 million the previous year. The change in working capital from year to year is due primarily increasing capital build-up during the quarter. At the end of the period, the group had unutilised credit facilities totalling SEK 1,427 million (393). </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><span>INVESTMENTS</span></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>The group&rsquo;s investments in fixed assets including business combinations totalled SEK 40 million (626) during the quarter and refer primarily to investments in fixed assets. In the previous year, Kirby HVAC &amp; Refrigeration Pty Ltd was acquired during the quarter.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><span>COMPANY ACQUISITIONS</span></strong><span> </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>No major acquisitions were made during the quarter, but the company is continuously evaluating new opportunities for growth and complementary acquisitions. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>The group made a small asset acquisition in Switzerland of a distributor of insulation materials, Durissol, amounting to SEK 3.6 m, which gives the company exclusive rights to their products for five years.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><span>SIGNIFICANT EVENTS AFTER THE QUARTER </span></strong><span> </span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>The group has made a minor supplementary acquisition after the quarter of the remaining shares in AC &amp; Ref Parts CQ Patton Pty Ltd in Australia and now owns 100% of the company. The company has annual sales of approximately SEK 25 million through two sales branches. The company is included in its entirety in the consolidated accounts with effect from 1 July 2019.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><span>THE SHARE</span></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Since 2 January 2019, Beijer Ref&rsquo;s B share has been listed on Nasdaq OMX Stockholm's Large Cap list. The share capital in Beijer Ref totals SEK 371,685,513, made up of 127,434,690 shares, each with a quota value of SEK 2.92. There are two types of share, A shares and B shares, with ten and one vote respectively. Beijer Ref had 7,893 shareholders on 28 June 2019. At present there are 9,918,720 A shares and 117,515,970 B shares.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><span>RISK DESCRIPTION</span></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>The Beijer Ref Group&rsquo;s operations are subject to a number of business environment factors, the effects of which on the Group&rsquo;s operating profit can be controlled to varying degrees. The Group&rsquo;s operations depend on general economic trends, primarily in Europe, which determine demand for Beijer Ref&rsquo;s products and services. Acquisitions are normally associated with risks, for example loss of key employees. Other operating risks, such as agency and supplier agreements, product liability and delivery commitments, technical development, warranties, dependence on key individuals, etc., are analysed continually. Where necessary, measures are taken to reduce the Group&rsquo;s risk exposure. In its operations, Beijer Ref is subject to financial risks such as currency risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk. The Parent&rsquo;s risk profile is the same as that of the Group. For further information, see the Group&rsquo;s Annual Report.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><span>ACCOUNTING POLICIES</span></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>This interim report was prepared in accordance with IAS 34, the Swedish Annual Accounts Act and RFR 2. Beijer Ref continues to apply the same accounting policies and valuation methods as described in the most recent annual report.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><em><span>IFRS 16 Leases</span></em>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>IFRS 16 Leases, is applied from 1 January 2019. Beijer Ref has chosen to report the transition to the new standard using the simplified method. The relief rule not to create a comparative year has been applied. A discount rate has been defined per each country and are decided quarterly. Right of use agreements of less than 12 months are reported as short-term agreements and are therefore not included in the reported liabilities or rights of use. Right of use agreements with an acquisition value below USD 5,000 have been classified as low-value agreements and are not included in the reported liabilities or rights of use. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>The lease portfolio contains approximately 1,500 contracts and comprises primarily operational leases for offices, warehouses, company cars, forklift trucks and office equipment. Beijer Ref has identified many agreements, primarily relating to properties, with the right to extend. As a result of these considerations, many leases have been deemed to be longer. All leases relating to properties that fall due in 2019 have been extended by three years.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Comparative information is not recalculated and is still reported in accordance with IAS 17 Leases and IFRIC 4 Determining whether an Agreement contains a Lease.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><em><span>Financial assets and liabilities by category and measurement level</span></em></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Financial assets and liabilities consist of financial assets valued at fair value and also financial assets and liabilities valued to discounted acquisition cost. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Financial assets valued at fair value consist of two holding, one of which (SEK 22 million) refers to listed shares and is valued at market value on the balance sheet date (measurement level 1). The second holding (SEK 25 million) is an unlisted holding and is valued at estimated fair value (measurement level 3). Financial assets valued at discounted acquisition cost, such as accounts receivables including other receivables and liquid funds, amount to SEK 4 131 million on the balance sheet date and financial liabilities, such as trade creditor including other liabilities, borrowing and other long-term liabilities, amount to SEK 7 432 million.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Financial interest-bearing liabilities such as borrowing linked to financing are valued at discounted acquisition cost and are considered representing a reasonable approximation of the fair value.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><span>WEB MEETING Q2 2019</span></strong></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>The company invites investors, analysts and the media to attend a web meeting at which CEO Per Bertland and CFO Maria Ryd&eacute;n present the interim report for the second quarter of 2019.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 14pt"><strong><strong>Continued strong development</strong></strong></span></p><p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Net Sales increased by 32 per cent in the first quarter compared to the same period last year and amounted to SEK 3,434 million (2,605). Organic growth was 8%.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>The operating profit for the quarter amounted to SEK 244 million (172), an increase of 42% compared with the same period last year. The operating margin was 7.1% (6.6%), of which 0.2% is a positive IFRS 16 effect.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Profit for the period totalled SEK 170 million (121). Profit per share totalled SEK 1.33 (0.92).</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>With effect from 1 January 2019, the company applies IFRS 16 with regard to the group's leasing agreements and all figures for 2019 include this change. The conversion affected operating profit positively by SEK 7 million and net profit by SEK 1 million. The equity ratio has decreased by 4 percentage points due to the increased balance sheet total.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>As of 2 January 2019, the Beijer Ref share is being traded on Nasdaq Stockholm's Large Cap.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><span>Comments by the CEO</span></strong></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><span>The acquisitions deliver</span></strong></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>The first quarter of 2019 lived up to the targets we had set. In total, net sales amounted to SEK 3.4 billion (2.6 billion), an increase of 32%, of which 20 per cent is from acquisitions and 8 per cent is an organic increase in sales. Operating margin, including the effect of IFRS 16, amounted to 7.1% (6.6%), which is higher than the corresponding period last year, in spite of falling prices for refrigerants. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>All regions show growth. It is particularly positive to see that the major acquisitions in the southern hemisphere that were conducted in 2018, TecsaReco in South Africa and Heatcraft in Australia, both contribute to our profits and also equalise seasonal variations. We are following developments in South Africa, which has been in recession for some years. Certain signs suggest that the country is moving towards GDP growth again, although other factors such as the forthcoming national elections may have effects.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>All of the group's market segments is growing and in the first quarter the area of commercial refrigeration represents 54% of Beijer Ref&rsquo;s sales. Air conditioning, HVAC, is growing by two-digit numbers and now accounts for about 36% of the group's sales. Prices of refrigerants continue to decline but they still remain at high levels. One effect of this is that the refrigerants' share of our total sales is more and more returning to normal. We are well prepared for the progressively changing market conditions, for which we have compensated with increasing sales of our sustainable product range. The significance for the group of the price trend for refrigerants has therefore gradually declined. The general market assessment is that prices may become stabilised during Q2 and then possibly rise slightly in the autumn. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Conversion to sustainable solutions continues to drive demand for our environmentally friendly technology. The permitted quantity of CO2 equivalents is restricted even more tightly for 2021. This generates increased pressure on the market to adapt to the new rules and we see a steadily arising awareness of this when we meet our customers. As a result, increased orders have been good for the company's OEM range. We continuously look at how we can expand our own production capacity, which is a requirement for being able to meet the expected future demand for sustainable refrigeration installations.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Interest in the market for environmentally friendly refrigerants is great, and we see it as our task and our responsibility to inform and educate customers and partners in how to handle such refrigerants. Our training programme "Beijer Ref Academy", which we launched last year in Italy, has been a success. We will be setting up similar programmes in more countries during 2019.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>We continue to work on digitalisation and have launched an e-commerce platform in Germany, the United Kingdom and Switzerland, among others. We will launch e-commerce in a number of other markets during the year. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Beijer Ref is now a well-known market leader, not only in Europe but also on other continents. As a natural consequence, we are spreading our name to a greater extent, so that some of our subsidiaries are successively changing their names to Beijer Ref. The latest in the line is our Indian company, which from March this year is called Beijer Ref India. Also new is that we have taken a global approach to certain products and components by creating a dedicated product series, which will be launched later in the year. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>One date that stands out during the quarter was 2 January, when our share moved up onto Nasdaq's Large Cap list. This was a milestone in the group's history and the list change has been an objective. This is proof that our long-term global strategy is working.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>The quarter did not contain any new acquisitions, but we are continuously evaluating a number of opportunities. Liquidity is good and cash flow has been positive during the quarter. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Conditions for the second quarter are favourable and we are following our expressed strategy so as to create further profitable growth. The team spirit in the group is strong. This provides the conditions for being able to continue to deliver good returns for our shareholders.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><span>Per Bertland</span></strong><span>, CEO</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><span>First quarter of 2019</span></strong></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><span>NET SALES</span></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Beijer Ref increased sales by 32 per cent to SEK 3,434 million (2,605) during the first quarter of 2019, 20% of which is explained by the acquisitions made during 2018, which have a high season during the winter months, as well as generally favourable economic conditions in the company's other markets. All regions show growth in net sales. Adjusted for exchange rate changes and acquisitions, organic growth in net sales was 8 per cent. A weakened Swedish krona resulted in positive currency effects of SEK 104 million, corresponding to 4%, since most of the company&rsquo;s sales are in currencies other than Swedish kronor.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><span>PROFIT</span></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>The Group&rsquo;s operating profit totalled SEK 244 million (172) during the first quarter, which is an increase of 42 per cent. The operating margin was 7.1% (6.6%), in spite of falling refrigerant prices.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>The profit before tax was SEK 228 million (167). Profit for the period was SEK 170 million (121). Profit per share totalled SEK 1.33 (0.92).</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><span>CASH FLOW</span></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Cash flow from operating activities before change in working capital was SEK 278 million in 2019 compared with SEK 153 million for 2018. The increase is due to improved profit during the quarter and a positive effect of SEK 71 million related to depreciation of rights of use assets arising from the transition to the IFRS 16 (lease). The corresponding amount of SEK 71 million is reported as a decrease in the financing operations.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Working capital increased by SEK 42 million during the quarter compared with SEK 112 million the previous year. This gives cash flow from operating activities of SEK 236 million, compared with SEK 41 million the previous year. The change in working capital between the years is mainly due to a smaller build-up of stocks during the quarter.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>At the end of the period, the company had unutilised credit facilities totalling SEK 1,588 million (205).</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><span>INVESTMENTS</span></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>The Group&rsquo;s investments in fixed assets including business combinations totalled SEK 27 million (349) during the first quarter and relate primarily to investments in fixed assets. In the previous year, TecsaReco was acquired during the quarter.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><span>COMPANY ACQUISITIONS</span></strong><span> </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>No acquisitions were made during the quarter, but the company is continuously evaluating new opportunities for growth and complementary acquisitions. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>In the first quarter of 2018, the acquisition of the wholesale company TecsaReco in South Africa was completed. The company has annual sales of SEK 450 million with 300 employees across 23 branches. The company is included in the consolidated accounts with effect from 1 March 2018.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><span>SIGNIFICANT EVENTS DURING THE QUARTER </span></strong><span> </span><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>As of 2 January 2019, the Beijer Ref share is being traded on Nasdaq Stockholm's Large Cap.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><span>RISK DESCRIPTION</span></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>The Beijer Ref Group&rsquo;s operations are subject to a number of business environment factors, the effects of which on the Group&rsquo;s operating profit can be controlled to varying degrees. The Group&rsquo;s operations depend on general economic trends, primarily in Europe, which determine demand for Beijer Ref&rsquo;s products and services. Acquisitions are normally associated with risks, for example loss of key employees. Other operating risks, such as agency and supplier agreements, product liability and delivery commitments, technical development, warranties, dependence on key individuals, etc., are analysed continually. Where necessary, measures are taken to reduce the Group&rsquo;s risk exposure. In its operations, Beijer Ref is subject to financial risks such as currency risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk. The Parent&rsquo;s risk profile is the same as that of the Group. For further information, see the Group&rsquo;s Annual Report.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><span>ACCOUNTING POLICIES</span></strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>This interim report was prepared in accordance with IAS 34, the Swedish Annual Accounts Act and RFR 2. Beijer Ref continues to apply the same accounting policies and valuation methods as described in the most recent annual report.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><em><span>IFRS 16 Leases</span></em>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>IFRS 16 Leases, is applied from 1 January 2019. Beijer Ref has chosen to report the transition to the new standard using the simplified method. The relief rule not to create a comparative year has been applied. A discount rate has been defined per each country and are decided quarterly. Right of use agreements of less than 12 months are reported as short-term agreements and are therefore not included in the reported liabilities or rights of use. Right of use agreements with an acquisition value below USD 5,000 have been classified as low-value agreements and are not included in the reported liabilities or rights of use. </span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>The lease portfolio contains approximately 1,500 contracts and comprises primarily operational leases for offices, warehouses, company cars, forklift trucks and office equipment. Beijer Ref has identified many agreements, primarily relating to properties, with the right to extend. As a result of these considerations, many leases have been deemed to be longer. All leases relating to properties that fall due in 2019 have been extended by three years.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>Comparative information is not recalculated and is still reported in accordance with IAS 17 Leases and IFRIC 4 Determining whether an Agreement contains a Lease.</span></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><strong><span>WEB MEETING Q1 2019</span></strong></p>
<p style="font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif"><span>The company invites investors, analysts and the media to attend a web meeting at which CEO Per Bertland and CFO Maria Ryd&eacute;n present the interim report for the first quarter of 2019. The presentation will be held in English and lasts for about 20 minutes. The meeting is on 16 April at 10.00 CET. </span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<div class="ingress">Beijer Ref and Carrier extend exclusive agreement to distribute Carrier DX’s comfort cooling products in several countries in Europe.</div>
Carrier is a leading global provider of innovative heating, ventilating and air conditioning (HVAC), as well as one of the largest owners in Beijer Ref AB. Beijer Ref, the world’s largest global refrigeration wholesaler, has had the exclusive rights to import and distribute Carrier-branded direct expansion residential and light commercial heating, ventilating and air conditioning products in a number of countries in Europe since 2015. Such distribution has just been extended until the end of year 2023.

As previously, the amendment gives Beijer Ref exclusive rights to distribute Carrier-branded direct expansion residential and light commercial HVAC products in several countries in Europe while allowing Carrier to sell Carrier-branded products in these countries.

Carrier Global Corporation became an independent, publicly traded company, following its separation from United Technologies Corporation on April 3, 2020. Carrier is now listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the symbol “CARR”.

Per Bertland, CEO Beijer Ref, comments:
<em>“It is pleasing that our collaboration with Carrier continues. Comfort cooling is a segment that is constantly growing, especially as consumer demand in Europe increases for air conditioning in the home. Carrier is a company which leads innovation in the market and has a strong product range, which in turn further strengthens Beijer Ref’s position in Europe.”</em>

Meredith Emmerich, Managing Director, Carrier Global RLC concurs:
<em>“We are happy to continue to strengthen our long-standing partnership with Beijer Ref to grow the Carrier brand. Beijer Ref’s geographic coverage and experience continues to drive strong adoption of the Carrier brand in residential and light commercial HVAC applications. Moving forward, both companies will promote the Carrier-brand which we believe is a win-win in expanding to more customers, who can enjoy Carrier’s innovative cooling and heating systems.”</em>

<p><span><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">The acquisition of the wholesale company ACD Trade in Australia was completed in the first quarter of 2020. The company has 60 employees across 9 branches. The company is included in the group's financial statements with effect from 1 February 2020 and it has contributed SEK 554 million to sales.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom:11px"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="line-height:107%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">2020 has been greatly marked by the Covid-19 pandemic and its effects. Measures have been taken in all parts of the business to fend off the effects, in the second and third quarters in particular.</span></span></span></p>

<p align="left" style="text-align:left"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:#284561"><span style="font-size:16pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Comments by the CEO</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><strong><span style="font-size:14pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Stable conclusion to a challenging year</span></span></span></strong></span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">2020 was a year largely marked by the corona pandemic and we took swift action to mitigate the negative effects of a market that was characterised by tough restrictions and shutdowns. Our savings programme and rapid reorganisation have paid off. Compared to the second quarter, which was the period most affected by closures, markets have remained relatively stable in the last few months in spite of new restrictions. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">The group's net sales for the fourth quarter are in line with sales in the same period last year and amounted to SEK 3.4 billion. Organically, our Central Europe and Asia Pacific regions have experienced growth and southern Europe is in line with the previous year.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Operating profit amounted to SEK 256 million in the fourth quarter, which is in line with the corresponding quarter of 2019. Apart from the acquisition of ACD Trade, it is mainly the effects of Covid-19 and lower prices of refrigerants that have affected earnings. Volume, but above all the fall in the price of refrigerants, has led to a loss of sales of approximately SEK 60 million in the quarter, and almost SEK 450 million on an annual basis. There are some indications that refrigerant prices are stabilising. The EU rules for phasing out f-gases, which regulate the permissible amount of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent emissions, were further tightened at the end of the year, which may affect the price. However, we do not expect the same development as in 2018. My assessment is that future price changes will not affect Beijer Ref's performance to the same degree as they have in the last two years.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Our HVAC product area shows growth of just over 3 per cent in the fourth quarter. In general, the demand for air conditioning and heat pumps is rising and therefore it is positive that we succeeded in performing an acquisition in this area at the end of the year. The Czech HVAC company Sinclair is from 1 January 2021 part of our group, which strengthens our overall offering. The company distributes products to several countries in Europe, mainly through its own brand. A brand that we will further develop and launch in other Beijer Ref markets. It is also gratifying that our Dutch company Coolmark had one of its strongest quarters ever with an organic sales increase of 14 per cent. Coolmark's profits increased by approximately 50 per cent for the full year, which shows that there will be a big impact on profits as sales increase. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Apart from lower refrigerant prices, the Commercial refrigeration product area grew by approximately 2 per cent in the quarter. This part of our business is socially important, which has allowed us to keep activity at a stable level even during periods of shutdowns. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">The entire OEM product area had an organic sales loss of 6 per cent compared to the same quarter last year. The decrease can be attributed to geographical areas such as the Nordic region and Africa,<br>
where restrictions due to the pandemic have made investment decisions delayed for a quarter. In Italy, we are now preparing to open operations in our new, environmentally friendly production facility, which will double capacity in the sustainable self-produced segment. Orders received in Q4 have been strong, meaning that we are entering the new year with a well-stocked order book.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">OEM is a focus area and it is therefore positive that we were able to perform another acquisition that strengthens our offering in the product area. By investing in the Danish company Fenagy, with the option to take over as principal owner within a few years, we will be able to offer sustainable industrial heat pumps on the northern European market based on the environmentally friendly refrigerant CO<sub>2</sub>.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">At the end of the year, Beijer Ref had a new principal owner in EQT when Carrier decided to sell its holding. This is a statement of strength and a recognition that what we have built up is considered to be viable for a long time to come. EQT will greatly contribute to Beijer Ref's continued journey of growth, through its knowledge and broad network.&nbsp; </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">I would also like to take this opportunity to thank Carrier for eleven years of successful cooperation. They have been involved in the globalisation of Beijer Ref and have opened many doors for us. I am pleased that in the future we will continue our cooperation, since Carrier is an important supplier. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">As I mentioned, 2020 has been a special year in many ways. When we sum up the year, we still have a lot to be proud of. The rapid adaptation to a new reality has required a great deal from our employees, who made it possible through their sacrifices, carried out with great loyalty.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Our balance sheet is strong and we have every opportunity to continue growing, both organically and through acquisitions. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">The board's proposal for an increased dividend reflects our optimistic confidence in the future and hopefully 2021 will be the year in which the business returns to normal.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:9pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Net sales decreased by 0.8 per cent to SEK 3,408 million (3,435) in the fourth quarter of 2020. The decrease in sales has been greatest in the Nordic region, southern Europe and Africa and is due to exchange rate changes and Covid-19. Apart from exchange rate changes and acquisitions, the organic change in net sales was -0.6 per cent (0.9).&nbsp; </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:9pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Air conditioning has however developed strongly during the quarter and has grown organically by 3.4%, largely thanks to good cooperation with Toshiba, Mitsubishi Heavy, Carrier and Gree. Sales development in air conditioning has been strong in all regions except Africa and Eastern Europe, and particularly strong in the Nordic region and Central Europe. A stronger Swedish krona resulted in exchange rate effects of SEK -216 million (111), corresponding to -6.2 per cent (3.4), since most sales are in currencies other than Swedish kronor. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:9pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Net sales decreased by 5.1 per cent to SEK 14,062 million (14,817) during 2020. Adjusted for exchange rate changes and acquisitions, the organic change in net sales was -6.2 per cent (4.4). The main reasons are the effects of Covid-19 and lower prices for refrigerants. The decrease in sales has affected all geographical segments and had the greatest impact in Southern and Central Europe.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

The transition will take place when a successor has been found or during the latter part of 2021 at the latest. Per intends to remain active within Beijer Ref by making himself available to join the Board of Directors, if supported by the shareholders. Beijer Ref’s largest shareholder, EQT Private Equity, has expressed its intention to call for a general meeting whereby they will nominate Per as a member of the Board of Directors.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="line-height:120%"><span><span style="vertical-align:middle"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Bernt Ingman, Chairman of the Board of Directors, says: “I would like to thank Per for his outstanding contributions to Beijer Ref. Today, the company is a market-leader with presence in 37 countries and Beijer Ref has enjoyed several years of strong growth in both sales and earnings during Per’s tenure as CEO. The Board and I regret that Per has chosen to step down but we fully respect his decision to retire from his operational position. The search for a successor will now begin”.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

Beijer Ref has a strong culture and I have truly enjoyed working with all my fantastic colleagues around the world. Today, the company is stronger than ever and I have therefore made the decision that now is the right time to initiate an orderly transition of leadership. If elected by the shareholders, my ambition is to remain active within Beijer Ref as a member of the Board of Directors, as I believe that I can continue to contribute to future growth and success for Beijer Ref through my industry network and experience.”</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

Sales are made through a distribution network of three branches in Queensland. Annual sales amount to approximately SEK 130 million. Beijer Ref acquires CAS from one main principal owner. Beijer Ref is already present in Australia through Beijer Ref Australia, Kirby and ACD Trade. The acquisition strengthens the Group’s overall presence in APAC-region and sales amounts to about 3 billion SEK.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

CAS is a well-managed and fast-growing company that will add value to our group in the form of a broader product range within air conditioning. CAS is already an existing supplier to Beijer in Australia in Queensland. This acquisition greatly enhances our position in the residential ducted market and, more broadly into the commercial segment of our industry. CAS’s products, experience and expertise will complement our Air conditioning product offering as well as adding to our existing customer base.”</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

Through the acquisition of 85% of the shares in Sinclair Global Group (Sinclair) with the option to acquire the remaining shares, Beijer Ref takes additional market shares within HVAC. Sinclair is headquartered in Brno, Czech Republic with sales offices in Slovakia, Hungary and Croatia. Sinclair sells air conditioning and heat pumps to 25 countries and most of the sales consist of HVAC products of the Sinclair own brand.</span></span></span></span></strong></span></span></span></p>

The company and its brand are mainly represented in Eastern Europe, but in recent years have also established their products in Western Europe preferably on the German market. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

Sinclair will be included in the company’s financial statements from January 1, 2021. Sinclair’s products will continue to be distributed and marketed under its own brand with existing sales channels but will also be launched in several of Beijer Ref’s other markets. </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

It is gratifying that we have been able to complete this acquisition during the current pandemic and we look forward to continuing to develop the company and the brand in several markets in the future,” concludes Per Bertland.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

Acquisition effects amounted to 3.3% (1.7%). Currency effects amounted to -4.5% (2.7%). Organic growth was -1.7% (5.2%), mainly due to lower refrigerant prices. Covid-19 has also had a negative impact, but the end of the quarter shows sales on a par with the previous year. The company's product area in HVAC business shows organic growth of 8.5%.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">The operating profit for the quarter amounted to SEK 342M (358), a decrease of 4.5% compared with the same period last year, which was mainly due to lower refrigerant prices. The operating margin amounted to 8.9% (9.1%). </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Profit before tax was SEK 329M (344). Net financial items are better than in the previous year, mainly due to improved cash flow and lower net liabilities.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Profit per share before and after dilution amounted to SEK 1.92 (2.00) and SEK 1.91 (1.99) respectively, &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; which is a decrease of 4%.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Cash flow from current activities was positive during the quarter and amounts to SEK 381M (371). Unused credit amounts to SEK 1,484M (1,480). During the quarter, Beijer Ref has performed refinancing of SEK 2.9 billion of the granted credit facilities, originally maturing in November 2020. The refinancing is distributed among four different banking partners and with average maturity of three years and eight months.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">During the third quarter, Beijer Ref signed a new exclusive agreement with Carrier International Corporation until 2023 regarding the continued sale and distribution of Carrier's comfort cooling product lines on the European market.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Net sales decreased by 6.4% during the period compared to the same period last year and amounted to SEK 10,654M (11,383). Acquisition effects amounted to 3.0% (8.5%). Currency effects amounted to -1.6% (3.0%). Organic growth was -7.8% (5.6%).</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">The operating profit for the period amounted to SEK 780M (975), a decrease of 20% compared with the previous year. The operating margin amounted to 7.3% (8.6%). The reason is mainly lower net &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sales due to Covid-19 and lower prices of refrigerants. The operating profit includes net savings of approximately SEK 230M.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Profit before tax was SEK 738M (932). Net financial items are better than in the previous year, mainly due to improved cash flow and lower net liabilities.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Profit per share before and after dilution amounted to SEK 4.29 (5.41) and SEK 4.26 (5.37) respectively, which is a decrease of 21%.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">The acquisition of the wholesale company ACD Trade in Australia was completed in the first quarter of 2020. The company has annual sales of SEK 540M with 60 employees across 9 branches. The company is included in the group's financial statements with effect from 1 February 2020 and it has contributed SEK 346M to sales.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom:11px"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="line-height:107%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">The first nine months of the year have been greatly marked by the Covid-19 pandemic and its effects. Measures have been taken in all parts of the business to fend off some of the effects.</span></span></span></p>

<p align="left" style="text-align:left"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:#284561"><span style="font-size:16pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Comments by the CEO</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">The second quarter of the year was largely marked by closed markets with gradual recovery, a trend that has continued in the third quarter. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Organic growth was -1.7% in the quarter. This is an acceptable figure in view of the ongoing Covid-19 pandemic and the continued fall in the price of refrigerants. It must also be taken into account that we have a challenging comparison with the previous year's heat wave in July. We regard August and September as normal months in terms of organic growth. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">The refrigeration segment shows negative organic growth of 8.5%, most of which can be explained by lower prices of refrigerants. Towards the end of the period, we have seen signs of some stabilisation in prices and a cautious assessment is that refrigerant prices will not have as great an impact on future quarters. The next reduction in the permitted amount of f-gases will take place in January 2021 when the permissible volume is reduced by a further 29% in Europe, which can affect the market.&nbsp; </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">One cause for celebration is the HVAC business, which shows organic sales growth of 8.5%. Sales development has been strong in all geographical regions except Africa. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">In general, the OEM business is in a positive phase, even though organic growth was negative by 5% in the third quarter. This is an effect of temporarily deferred investment decisions by end customers due to the Covid-19 crisis. During the third quarter, orders received have gradually increased and are now at a relatively high level. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">The cost-cutting program launched at the end of March has reduced costs during the period by approximately SEK 80 million. The majority of the savings are from reduced personnel costs and consist of permanent as well as temporary reductions. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">We continue to work according to our global digitalisation strategy and during the period the business in Australia has implemented the same cloud-based platform as our companies in New Zealand. Europe is next and work on further implementations is already underway. Experience from the installations in Australia and New Zealand contributes to a smooth process. In parallel, e-commerce is being developed and this is constantly growing stronger.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Despite an expanded security system, our operations in France suffered a cyber attack, which led to a shutdown of computer systems for a week. We estimate that the total effect of the outage amounts to approximately SEK 25 million in lower sales and approximately SEK 8 million in lower profits. We are now further reviewing operational security to avoid this type of attack in the future. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">A strong cash flow and a strong balance sheet make us well prepared for new acquisitions. There are a number of possibilities that we are analysing at the moment. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">In September, the largest shareholder Carrier sold approximately 9 million shares in one placement, which corresponds to 7.9% of the total number of shares. The offer was quickly oversubscribed, which we see as proof that the market has confidence in our business and our share and sees potential for further development. Carrier remains the largest shareholder and, as in the past, will be an important trading partner for us. It is important to point out that the transaction does not affect our good business relations.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Although the outside world is currently uneasy, we have a positive outlook for the future. Megatrends benefit us, a decentralised organisation with motivated employees gives power for growth and a strong balance sheet opens up business opportunities for acquisitions.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:9pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Beijer Ref net sales decreased by 2.9 per cent to SEK 3,837 million (3,953) in the third quarter of 2020. Adjusted for exchange rate changes and acquisitions, organic change in net sales was -1.7 per cent (5.2). The main reason is lower prices of refrigerants. Covid-19 has also had a negative impact. The decrease in sales has affected all geographical segments but had the greatest impact in southern Europe and Africa and the least impact in Asia Pacific. Air conditioning has developed strongly in 2020 and has grown organically by 8.5%, largely thanks to good cooperation with Toshiba, Mitsubishi Heavy, Carrier and Gree. Sales development within HVAC has been strong in all regions except Africa. It has been particularly strong in the Nordic countries and Eastern Europe.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:9pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">A stronger Swedish krona resulted in currency effects of SEK -182 million (91), corresponding to -4.5 per cent (2.7), since most sales are in currencies other than Swedish kronor.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:12pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><strong><span style="font-size:9pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">PROFIT</span></span></span></strong></span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:9pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">The group’s operating profit totalled SEK 342 million (358) during the third quarter, which is a decrease of 4.5 per cent. Exchange rate effects of SEK -14.1 million (9.7) are included in the operating profit figures. The operating margin amounted to 8.9 per cent (9.1). The reduction in profit is due to the effects of Covid-19, lower prices of refrigerants and a shift in the mix to a higher proportion of air conditioning. This is offset by net savings of approx. SEK 80 million. Operating profit also includes positive acquisition effects of SEK 7.5 million for the quarter. Profit before tax was SEK 329 million (344) and profit for the period was SEK 246 million (256). Profit per share before dilution amounted to SEK 1.92 (2.00).</span></span></span></span></span></p>

Working capital decreased by SEK 73 million during the quarter compared with SEK 212 million during the corresponding period of the previous year. Normally, the Group binds capital during the first half of the year and frees up capital in the second half of the year, but during the current pandemic, cash flow has been positive in previous quarters. The change in working capital between the years is due primarily to a decrease in capital tied up in stock. Altogether, this gives cash flow from current operations after changes in working capital of SEK 455 million (583). </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:9pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Cash flow from current operations for the first nine months of the year before changes in working capital amounted to SEK 903 million in 2020, compared with SEK 1,030 million for the corresponding period in 2019. The change is mainly due to lower profit during the quarter. Working capital decreased by SEK 77 million during the first nine-month period compared with an increase of SEK 256 million the previous year. The change in working capital between the years is due primarily to improved supplier conditions. Altogether, this gives cash flow from current operations after changes in working capital of SEK 979 million (774). </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:9pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">At the end of the period, credit facilities amounted to SEK 4,356 million (4,100), of which unutilised credits amounted to SEK 1,484 million (1,480). In total, net liabilities decreased from SEK 3,362 million to SEK 2,942 million. Refinancing of SEK 2.9 billion of the company's granted credit facilities occurred, divided over four different banking partners and with average maturity of three years and eight months.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

The company’s assessment is that Covid-19 will have a smaller effect on earnings for the remainder of 2020.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

Acquisition effects amounted to 2.6% (6.9%). Negative currency effects amounted to -1.3% (2.6%). Organic growth was negative at -17.8% (4.4%). The end of the quarter shows a recovery and sales on a par with the previous year.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">The operating profit for the quarter amounted to SEK 241 M (373), a decrease of 35% compared with the same period last year. The operating margin amounted to 7.2% (9.3%). The main reason is the effects of Covid-19, but also to some extent lower prices for refrigerants.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

Unutilised credits amount to SEK 913M (1,427). Beijer Ref has performed a procurement and will after the end of the quarter extend the outstanding credits that fall due in November 2020.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">During the quarter, the group entered into a partnership with compressor manufacturer Bitzer in Australia and New Zealand; the group has previously entered into partnerships for Europe, Asia and Africa. Under the new agreement, Beijer Ref will be able to offer a complete range of Bitzer's product portfolio. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">After the end of the quarter, Beijer Ref signed a new exclusive agreement with Carrier International Corporation until 2023 regarding the continued sale and distribution of Carrier's comfort cooling product lines on the European market.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><strong><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">First half 2020</span></span></span></strong></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Net sales decreased by 8.3% in the first half compared to the same period last year and amounted to SEK 6,816M (7,430). Acquisition effects amounted to 2.9% (12.4%). Negative currency effects amounted to -0.3% (3.3%). Organic growth was negative at -10.9% (5.8%).</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">The operating profit for the period amounted to SEK 438M (617), a decrease of 29% compared with the same period last year. The operating margin amounted to 6.4% (8.3%). The main reasons are the effects of Covid-19 and lower prices for refrigerants.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Profit before tax was SEK 409M (588). Net financial items are unchanged compared with previous years despite increased borrowing in connection with the acquisition of ACD Trade at the beginning of the year.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Profit per share before and after dilution amounted to SEK 2.37 (3.40) and SEK 2.35 (3.38) respectively, which is a decrease of 30%.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">The acquisition of the wholesale company ACD Trade in Australia was completed in the first quarter of 2020. The company has annual sales of SEK 540M with 60 employees across 9 branches. The company is included in the consolidated accounts with effect from 1 February 2020.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Beijer Ref has been affected by Covid-19 since the middle of March. Measures have been taken in all parts of the business to fend off some of the effects. This has led to net savings amounting to approximately SEK 150M during the period and the total net savings for 2020 are estimated to be approximately SEK 200M. The assessment is that Covid-19 will have a smaller effect on the group's earnings for the remainder of 2020, but the situation is difficult to assess.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:left" align="left"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-size:16pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="color:#1e2736">Comments by the CEO</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="line-height:120%"><strong><span style="font-size:16pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="color:#1e2736">Impact of Covid-19 in the second quarter</span></span></span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">As expected, the effects of Covid-19 have had full impact in the second quarter, a period characterised by virtually completely closed markets. Lost sales during the first half of the year amount to approximately SEK 1 billion, of which SEK 700 M can be attributed to the second quarter, where April and the first half of May were particularly heavily affected by the effects of the Corona pandemic. Since then, we have been able to monitor week by week how the markets have gradually opened up and sales at the end of June were on a par with the corresponding period last year, which is a faster recovery than our previous estimates. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Covid-19 has undoubtedly been a severe test for Beijer Ref and the world at large and I am proud and grateful for how our organisation and employees have shown loyalty, drive and flexibility in a situation that has been extreme. It shows once again our strength as a global group. When we realised that the world was facing a pandemic, major cost adjustments were immediately performed. During the first half of the year, these measures resulted in a saving of approximately SEK 150 M. We are prepared and have planned for further savings, but are awaiting developments to see at what level the market stabilises during the third quarter. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Although the period has been very different from previous years, we see clear signs that our HVAC segment is growing ever stronger. This is not only in the current year; if we look back, we can see several consecutive years in which air conditioning has seen increasing sales growth. We are seeing structural changes in the market, which means that air conditioning has in many respects gone from being something that was previously regarded as a luxury, but which is now increasingly regarded as a general everyday need. This becomes particularly clear during the summer months, even this year. It is therefore gratifying that we have concluded a new exclusivity agreement with Carrier for comfort cooling. During the period, we also signed an agreement with the compressor manufacturer Bitzer for the distribution of their products in Australia and New Zealand. Both partnerships strengthen Beijer Ref's global growth and presence.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">In general, our market is relatively insensitive to cyclical changes. It will continue to be driven by a number of megatrends, not least the phasing-out programme for environmentally hazardous HFC gases. The transition to greener alternatives is continuing, and we are working actively to provide the market with such offers. The digitalisation of our business is currently developing slightly faster than our previous estimates, partly due to the fact that we have launched e-commerce in new markets. The closures due to Covid-19 are also judged to have had an effect. During the quarter, our e-commerce has set new sales records. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Price levels for refrigerants have so far this year been under some pressure but have still been relatively stable. However, the level is significantly lower than the corresponding period last year. Next year, the permitted volume of CO<sub>2</sub> equivalents in Europe will fall further, which may mean some stock build-up at our customers in the autumn.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Historically, business opportunities have arisen in times of crisis. In Beijer Ref's case, this may mean openings for new acquisitions in the coming quarters. We are following developments closely in order to be able to act quickly if opportunities arise.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Beijer Ref has previously become stronger in difficult times. Now too, I see opportunities for Beijer Ref to consolidate its position in the market as a leading global refrigeration wholesaler. We continue to work methodically according to our established strategy so to ensure positive long-term development for Beijer Ref.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:9pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Beijer Ref’s net sales decreased by 16.5 per cent to SEK 3,338M (3,996) during the second quarter of 2020. Adjusted for exchange rate changes and acquisitions, organic growth in net sales was negative at -17.8 per cent (4.4).</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:9pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">The main reasons are the effects of Covid-19 and lower prices of refrigerants, since most of the largest markets, which together account for about 70 per cent of sales, were almost completely shut down from mid-March to early May. Beijer Ref estimates that sales have decreased by approximately SEK 700M mainly as a result of Covid-19. The decrease in sales has affected all geographical segments and had the greatest impact in southern Europe and Africa and the least impact in Asia Pacific.

Negative exchange rate effects of SEK -2M (11) are included in the operating profit figures. The operating margin amounted to 7.2 per cent (9.3). The reduction in profit is due to the effects of Covid-19, lower prices of refrigerants and a shift in the mix to a higher proportion of air conditioning. Profit before tax was SEK 227M (359) and profit for the period was SEK 168M (265). Profit per share before dilution amounted to SEK 1.31 (2.08).</span></span></span></span></span></p>

At the beginning of 2020, macroeconomic conditions were relatively good, although a slight slowdown could be observed. However, the spread of the Covid-19 virus changed the situation drastically and the market reacted with sharp stock market falls and lower interest rates. So far, the consequences have been significant and it is too early at present to assess the overall effects the outbreak will have on Beijer Ref. From the middle of March to the beginning of May, markets representing 70% of the group's operations have been closed. It is estimated that the group's net sales have decreased by approximately SEK 700 M as a result of Covid-19. Measures have been taken to address the effects, including in the following areas:</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:9pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">• Adjusted purchasing and inventory build-up, as well as extended credit periods</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:9pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">The group estimates that savings amounting to approximately SEK 150M have taken effect during the period and the total net savings for 2020 are estimated to be approximately SEK 200M. Received subsidy amount to SEK 44.8M and received rental discounts amount to SEK 2.5M. These has been reported as reduction of cost. The group’s assessment is that Covid-19 will have a smaller effect on earnings for the remainder of 2020, but the situation is difficult to assess.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

The Meeting resolved in accordance with the proposals of the Board and the Nomination Committee.</span></span></strong></span></span></span></span></p><br>
<p><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span><span style="vertical-align:middle"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Today, 25 June 2020, Beijer Ref AB (publ) held its Annual Meeting of shareholders for the 2019 financial year.

As of the end of the first quarter of 2020, covid-19 has affected Beijer Ref’s operations as most of the company’s countries have been partially or completely closed. Historically, Beijer Ref has been relatively mildly affected by crises, mainly due to the fact that its activities are largely linked to the food industry, which is a so-called social carrier.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:11pt"><span style="line-height:120%"><span><span style="vertical-align:middle"><span style="color:black"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">”We believe that with a growing market, clear focus, strong corporate culture, decentralised organization, strong ownership structure, we have the future for us and can continue our journey of success”, concludes Per Bertland.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p></p>

<p><span><span style="font-size:12pt"><span><span><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="color:black"><strong><span style="font-size:10pt"><span><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Third quarter</span></span></span></strong></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Net sales increased by 13.1% (-2.9) in the third quarter compared to the same period last year and amounted to SEK 4,341 million (3,837). Organic growth amounted to 6.4% (-1.7) Acquisition effects amounted to 7.0% (3.3) and currency effects amounted to -0.3% (-4.5).</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">EBITA amounted to SEK 366 million (353), corresponding to an EBITA margin of 8.4% (9.2). The operating profit amounted to SEK 354 million (342), an increase of 3.6% compared with the previous year. The operating margin amounted to 8.2% (8.9%).</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Profit before tax was SEK 339 million (329). Interest costs are higher than the previous year due to increased borrowing because of the acquisitions performed. Net debt/EBITDA amounted to 2.1 (2.0). </span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Cash flow from current activities before change in working capital was positive and amounted to SEK 393 million (381). The company&#039;s liquidity remained good and the company&#039;s balance sheet is strong, with unutilized credit amounting to SEK 444 million (1,484). After the quarter, the company has taken up loans of SEK 600 million. Profit per share before and after dilution was 0.65 (0.64).</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">During the quarter, Beijer Ref increased its holding to just over 50 per cent in the Danish refrigeration technology company Fenagy A/S, which produces industrial heat pumps based on environmentally friendly refrigeration technology.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">An agreement has been signed to acquire 80% of the shares of the air conditioning company Inventor AG in Greece. The company has sales of just over SEK 750 million and about 80 employees. This will be Beijer Ref&#039;s 38th market and an important complement to Beijer Ref&#039;s existing product portfolio in HVAC.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">At the end of July, Beijer Ref acquired 100% of the shares of the distribution company Froid et Clim Distribution (FCD). The company has annual sales of SEK 20 million with five employees and a profitability that exceeds the region&#039;s profitability in APAC.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">On 31 August, 100% of the shares of the climate and ventilation company Armcor were acquired. The company has annual sales of approximately SEK 105 million with good profitability and 37 employees in Australia.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">During the quarter, Beijer Ref and Alfa Laval renewed their partnership and distribution agreement in a new three-year partnership agreement covering the entire group.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Christopher Norbye, new President and CEO of Beijer Ref, joined the company on 30 August 2021. He comes most recently from a position as Executive Vice President and Head of Entrance Systems Division at Assa Abloy and succeeds Per Bertland.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

Organic growth was 15.3% (-7.8). Acquisition effects amounted to 6.2% (3.0). Currency effects amounted to -2.9% (1.6).</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">EBITA amounted to SEK 1,072 million (815), corresponding to an EBITA margin of 8.5% (7.6). The operating profit for the period amounted to SEK 1,035 million (780), which is an increase of 32.7% compared with the previous year. The operating margin amounted to 8.2% (7.3).</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Profit before tax was SEK 989 million (738). Interest costs are higher than earlier years due to increased borrowing because of the acquisitions performed.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Profit per share before dilution amounted to SEK 1.92 (1.43) and after dilution to SEK 1.91 (1.42), an increase of 34.1 and 34.3 per cent respectively.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">2021 has been an active year and the company has made eight acquisitions, four of them in APAC and four in Europe.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Acquired annual sales amount to approximately SEK 1.6 billion, of which approximately SEK 850 million will have an effect on the current year. The acquisitions contribute positively to the group&#039;s operating profit. Seasonal variations occur and mean that demand and earnings are highest in quarters two and three in Europe and that quarters one and four are strongest in APAC.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Covid-19 has had some effect on the company&#039;s profit during the period; individual regions such as South Africa, Southeast Asia and Oceania have been affected. The assessment is that there will be no major impact on profits from Covid-19 in the fourth quarter, unless new outbreaks occur or existing lockdowns are extended.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span>The company&#039;s CEO Per Bertland announced his resignation in the first quarter of 2021 and the recruitment of a successor was completed during the second quarter.

<p><span><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span>Profit before tax was SEK 649 million (409).

<p><span><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span>After the end of the period, Beijer Ref entered into an agreement to increase its holding in the Danish refrigeration technology company Fenagy A/S, which produces environmentally friendly industrial heat pumps. With an investment of DKK 19 million, Beijer Ref expands its ownership to just over 50 per cent and thus becomes the majority shareholder. The company will be included in the financial statements with effect from 1 July 2021 and will have a minor impact on the company&#039;s results and position.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span>After the end of the period, an agreement was signed to acquire 80% of the shares in the air conditioning company Inventor AG in Greece, with the takeover expected in autumn 2021. The company has sales of just over SEK 600 million and about 80 employees. This will be Beijer Ref&#039;s 38th market and an important complement to Beijer Ref&#039;s existing product portfolio.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span>Thus far, acquired annual sales amount to approximately SEK 1.4 billion, of which approximately SEK 800 million has an effect on the current year, and contributes positively to the group&#039;s operating margin. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:11pt"><span>Covid-19 has had little effect on the company&#039;s profit during the period, although individual regions such as South Africa, Southeast Asia and Australia have been affected. The company does not expect any major impact on earnings related to Covid-19 in 2021 unless new outbreaks occur.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p align="left" style="text-align:left"><span style="font-size:16pt"><strong><span style="color:#1e2736">Comments from the CEO</span></strong></span><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p><span><span style="color:black"><strong><span style="font-size:14pt"><span>All Time High</span></span></strong></span></span><br />
&nbsp;</p>

<p><span><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span>To begin with, I would like to emphasise that it is gratifying to see how we are now approaching the light at the end of the pandemic tunnel. The world seems to be moving towards a gradual recovery and there are clear signs that societies are slowly but surely opening up; restrictions are easing, travel is increasing and everyday life is starting to normalise once again. In these circumstances, it feels good to report our strongest quarter to date, in terms of both sales and profit. Sales in the second quarter, compared to the corresponding period last year, increased by 37%, of which 34% is organic (an increase of 14% compared to Q2 2019). It is positive that large markets such as the Netherlands, France and Italy have performed well.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span>It is gratifying that we have been able to obtain majority ownership of Fenagy, a company that manufactures industrial air heat pumps based on environmentally friendly CO2 technology. Developments in the company have exceeded expectations and optimism for the future is great.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span>Another exciting piece of news is that after the end of the quarter we have signed an agreement to acquire Inventor, one of the leading air conditioning distributors in Greece, which is&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; highly profitable. The acquisition is in line with our strategy and means that Beijer Ref is establishing itself in a new market, the 38th in the world.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span>I am also happy with the acquisition of Sinclair, which was made in the first quarter. The investment in own brands is becoming increasingly important for Beijer Ref and it is satisfying to see how we have successfully launched Sinclair in our markets. The own brand for line components, Freddox, will also be gradually launched in an increasing number of markets.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span>In the beginning of July, it was an honour to inaugurate our new and energy efficient factory in Italy, which mainly produces sustainable refrigeration units based on natural refrigerants. As a result, we are doubling our capacity to produce environmentally friendly refrigeration units. At the same time, we are seeing prices of traditional refrigerants stabilise. In our assessment, future changes in the price of refrigerants will not have a significant impact on profit. I see this as a turning point for falling refrigerant prices.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span>Digital sales are increasing, partly as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. During the quarter, our e-commerce accounted for 10% of sales, compared to 6% last year. This is an area Beijer Ref will continue to invest in and where we see great development opportunities.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span>Like many other companies, Beijer Ref had to adapt quickly to prevailing conditions during the pandemic. Although we are in an industry that is quite insensitive to economic fluctuations, I think we have handled the situation well. We have largely compensated for price increases that have partly been due to component shortages in the world. Our assessment is that the component shortage has only affected the quarter to a limited extent.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span>I would also like to draw attention to all our ambitious and talented employees. Throughout the pandemic, our core values have clearly permeated everyone&#039;s commitment: we have been committed, engaged, straightforward and united. Everyone within the organisation has shown enterprise and innovation. Beijer Ref continues to consolidate its position as a world-leading refrigeration wholesaler and I look forward with hope to both the next quarter and the future.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:12pt"><span><span><span style="color:black"><strong><span style="font-size:10pt"><span>A big thank you</span></span></strong></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span>Q2 2021 will be my last report as CEO of Beijer Ref and I would like to extend a big thank you to all the people I have had the privilege of working with. The milestones are many, as are my memories. Far too many to fit into this text. I am very proud that we, as a decentralised organisation, have succeeded in creating a unified corporate culture, with common values and behaviour. Together we have taken a fantastic journey and laid the foundation for continued success. All my Beijer Ref colleagues will be missed. I would also like to thank my family, who have been by my side for all these years.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span>It is also with pride that I note that the concept of sustainability continues to be an important and integral part of Beijer Ref&#039;s strategy. Our ambition is to contribute to sustainable social development that creates long-term values for future generations. It is an honour to have been CEO of a company that actively works on these important issues. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span>In my new role as a board member, I will continue to engage in Beijer Ref&#039;s development. It is now with great confidence that I will hand over to our new CEO, Christopher Norbye, on 30 August. I am convinced that Christopher, together with our experienced employees, will continue to drive Beijer Ref&#039;s spirit and strategy forward. He has many years of experience in both global operations and decentralised organisations. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p align="left" style="text-align:left"><strong><span><span style="font-size:16pt"><span><span style="color:#1e2736">Second quarter of 2021</span></span></span></span></strong></p>

<p><span><strong><span style="font-size:9pt"><span><span style="color:#1e2736">NET SALES</span></span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:9pt"><span>Beijer Ref increased its net sales by 36.6 per cent to SEK 4,561 million (3,338) during the second quarter of 2021. Adjusted for exchange rate fluctuations and acquisitions, organic sales growth amounted to 33.8 per cent (-17.8), mainly due to price and volume increases. The group has had no negative effects from the falling prices for refrigerants during the quarter. A stronger Swedish krona resulted in currency effects of SEK -87 million (-63), corresponding to -3.5 per cent (1.3), since most sales are in currencies other than Swedish kronor.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:12pt"><span><span style="color:black"><strong><span style="font-size:9pt"><span><span style="color:#1e2736">PROFIT</span></span></span></strong></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:9pt"><span>The group&rsquo;s operating profit totalled SEK 418 million (241) during the second quarter, an increase of 73.5 per cent. Exchange rate effects of SEK -9.4 million (-2.3) are included in the operating profit figures. The operating margin amounted to 9.2 per cent (7.2). Aside from acquisition effects, the improved profit is mainly due to volume increases. Profit before tax amounted to SEK 402 million (227) and profit for the period was SEK 308 million (168). Profit per share before dilution amounted to SEK 0.79 (0.44).</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:12pt"><span><span style="color:black"><strong><span style="font-size:9pt"><span><span style="color:#1e2736">CASH FLOW</span></span></span></strong></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:9pt"><span>Cash flow from current activities before change in working capital during the second quarter amounted to SEK 499 million (303). Working capital increased by SEK 653 million during the quarter compared with a decrease of SEK 24 million during the corresponding period of the previous year. Normally, the group binds more capital in the first half of the year and frees up capital in the second half of the year. The change in working capital between the years is due primarily to higher accounts receivable. Altogether, this gives cash flow from current operations after changes in working capital of SEK -154 million (327).</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:9pt"><span>Cash flow from current operations before changes in working capital amounted to SEK 823 million during the period, compared with SEK 521 million for the corresponding period in 2020. The change is mainly due to a higher operating profit in 2021. Working capital has increased by SEK 639 million in 2021 compared to a decrease of SEK 3 million the previous year, mainly due to more acquisitions and higher accounts receivable as a result of the increase in sales. Altogether, this gives cash flow from current operations after changes in working capital of SEK 183 million (524).</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:9pt"><span>At the end of the period, credit facilities amounted to SEK 4,253 million (4,041), of which unutilised credits amounted to SEK 1,206 million (1,029). In total, net debts increased by SEK 606 million, mainly due to lower cash and cash equivalents due to dividends paid and increased interest-bearing liabilities in connection with acquisitions.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:12pt"><span><span style="color:black"><strong><span style="font-size:9pt"><span><span style="color:#1e2736">INVESTMENTS</span></span></span></strong></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:9pt"><span>Cash flow from investment activities during the quarter amounted to SEK -55 million (-48), which relates to business combinations and investments in non-current assets. During the second quarter, the company acquired Industrial Refrigeration Components.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:9pt"><span>Cash flow from investment activities during the period amounted to SEK -371 million (-267) and relates to Sinclair Global Group, Complete Air Supply, Coolair and Industrial Refrigeration Components.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:9pt"><span>Acquisitions are a priority area and in 2021 a number of companies have been acquired. At the end of 2020, the acquisition of 85% of the shares of Sinclair in the Czech Republic was completed, which is included in the group&#039;s financial statements with effect from 1 January 2021. During the period, the acquisition of all shares of Complete Air Supply in Australia and 60% of the shares of Coolair in Germany were concluded; these are included in the company&#039;s accounts from February and March 2021 respectively. At the end of June, the assets and liabilities of Industrial Refrigeration Components were acquired. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:9pt"><span>After the end of the period, Beijer Ref entered into an agreement to increase its holding in the Danish environmentally friendly refrigeration technology company Fenagy A/S. With an investment of DKK 19 million, Beijer Ref expands its ownership to just over 50 per cent and thus becomes the majority shareholder. The company will be included in the financial statements with effect from 1 July 2021 and will have a minor impact on the company&#039;s results and position.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:9pt"><span>After the end of the period, Beijer Ref signed an agreement to acquire 80% of the shares in the air conditioning company Inventor AG in Greece. The takeover is expected to take place during the autumn of 2021. The company has sales of just over SEK 600 million and about 80 employees. This will be Beijer Ref&#039;s 38th market and an important complement to the group&#039;s existing product portfolio.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:9pt"><span>In total, these companies have annual sales of approximately SEK 1.4 billion and contribute positively to the group&#039;s operating margin. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:9pt"><span>Sustainability is a well-integrated part of Beijer Ref. Doing business based on sound standards is a responsibility that the group takes very seriously, while at the same time it is woven in as a natural approach in all parts of the organisation. Beijer Ref&#039;s sustainability strategy is based on the UN&#039;s sustainable development goals in Agenda 2030, which cover economy, society and the environment. Beijer Ref believes that it is in the environmental field that Beijer Ref can make the biggest difference. In order to further strengthen the work to develop environmentally friendly refrigeration technology, the group measures the proportion of Beijer Ref&#039;s OEM sales that shall be environmentally friendly. The goal is for it to increase from today&#039;s 35% to 50%. On our website and in the annual report, we give more information about our goals and how we perform in relation to the goals.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:12pt"><span><span style="color:black"><strong><span style="font-size:9pt"><span><span style="color:#1e2736">RISK DESCRIPTION</span></span></span></strong></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:9pt"><span>Beijer Ref group&#039;s operations are affected by a number of external factors whose effects on the group&#039;s operating profit can be monitored to varying degrees. The group&#039;s operations depend on general economic developments in Europe in particular, which govern demand for Beijer Ref&#039;s products and services. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:9pt"><span>Like other global companies, Beijer Ref is affected by pandemics and in 2020 the group was affected by Covid-19. The company&rsquo;s assessment is that Covid-19 is having a smaller effect on earnings in 2021. The company is taking the necessary steps to reduce its impact and is following the WHO recommendations.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:9pt"><span>Acquisitions are normally associated with risks, such as loss of key personnel. Other operating risks, such as agency and supplier agreements, product liability and delivery commitments, technical development, guarantees, dependence on individuals etcetera, are continuously analysed. If necessary, measures are taken to reduce the group&#039;s risk exposure. In its operations, Beijer Ref is exposed to financial risks such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk. The parent company&#039;s risk pattern is the same as that of the group. For further information, see the group&#039;s annual report.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:9pt"><span>This interim report was prepared in accordance with IAS 34, the Swedish Annual Accounts Act and RFR 2. Beijer Ref continues to apply the same accounting policies and valuation methods as described in the most recent annual report. Information pursuant to IAS 34.16A, in addition to disclosure in the financial reports and their associated notes, also appears in other parts of the interim report.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:12pt"><span><span style="color:black"><em><span style="font-size:9pt"><span>Financial assets and liabilities by category and level of valuation</span></span></em></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:9pt"><span>The group&#039;s financial assets and liabilities consist of financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income and financial assets and liabilities valued at accrued acquisition value. Financial assets valued at fair value through other comprehensive income consist of three holdings, one of which (SEK 20M) refers to listed shares and is valued at market value on the balance sheet date (valuation level 1). The two other holdings (SEK 34M) is unlisted holdings and is valued at estimated fair value (valuation level 3). Financial assets valued at accrued acquisition value, such as trade receivables and other receivables, as well as cash and cash equivalents, amount to SEK 4,550M on the balance sheet date and financial liabilities valued at accrued acquisition value such as accounts payable, leasing liabilities and borrowings, as well as other long-term liabilities, amount to SEK 7,997M. Financial interest-bearing liabilities such as loans linked to financing are entered at accrued acquisition value and are considered to constitute a good estimate of fair value taking into account the fixed terms and the setting of interest rates.</span></span></span></span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><span style="font-size:11pt"><span><span><span style="vertical-align:middle"><strong><span style="color:black">Beijer Ref has signed an agreement to acquire 80% of the shares in the air conditioning company Inventor, with the option to acquire the remaining share, thereby establishing itself on the Greek market. Inventor has had good profitability over the past four years, with annual sales growth of 19% and EBIT growth of 40% over the last 4-year period. The company has many years of experience in the </span></strong><strong>HVAC segment and have a strong recognition with its own brand, Inventor.</strong> </span></span></span></span><br />
<br />
<span style="font-size:11pt"><span><span><span style="vertical-align:middle"><span style="color:black">Inventor&rsquo;s head office is located in Athens (Greece), with a second sales office in Bucharest (Romania). Its primary sales channels are retailers and installers, but Amazon&rsquo;s e-trading is also an important platform &ndash; which is a new distribution channel for Beijer Ref.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:11pt"><span><span><span style="vertical-align:middle"><span style="color:black">The parties have signed a binding agreement, after which the competition authority in Romania will now review the transaction. The takeover is expected to take place during the autumn of 2021. Inventor&rsquo;s annual sales amount to just over SEK 600 million and the company has approximately 80 employees.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:11pt"><span><span><span style="vertical-align:middle"><span style="color:black">Inventor will continue to operate under its own brand, in both distribution and marketing. The acquisition will have a positive impact on the Beijer Ref Group&rsquo;s results and position.</span></span></span></span></span><br />

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><span><span><span style="vertical-align:middle"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span><span style="color:black">Beijer Ref has entered into an agreement to increase its holding in the Danish refrigeration technology company Fenagy A/S. With an investment of DKK 19 million, Beijer Ref expands its ownership to just over 50 percent and thus becomes the majority shareholder. The company will be included in the financial accounts as of July 1, 2021, and will have a minor impact on the company&rsquo;s earnings and position.</span></span></span></span></span></span></strong></p>

<p><span><span><span style="vertical-align:middle"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span><span style="color:black">The investment gives Fenagy the financial conditions necessary to strengthen the organization and meet the needs of the market.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span style="vertical-align:middle"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span><span style="color:black">Beijer Ref made its first investment in Fenagy in November 2020 by acquiring 20 percent of the company. Fenagy, a relatively newly formed company, manufactures industrial heat pumps and refrigeration systems based on the environmentally friendly refrigerant CO2. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span style="vertical-align:middle"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span><span style="color:black">Per Bertland, CEO of Beijer Ref, comments:</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span style="vertical-align:middle"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span><span style="color:black">&ldquo;It is very gratifying and exciting to increase our ownership of Fenagy, which means that we will be able to support the future international expansion even more. Sales have exceeded our expectations and we are very pleased with the collaboration, and we look forward to continuing develop the company in the future. Fenagy&rsquo;s product range well complements our OEM offering in green refrigeration technology.&rdquo;</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

At the request of shareholders, 360 000 Class A shares have been converted into 360 000 Class B shares. Through the reclassification, the total number of votes in the company decreases.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span>After the conversion, the total number of shares and votes in Beijer Ref amounts to 382 304 070 shares and 633 909 510 votes, respectively. 27 956 160 of these shares are A shares, representing 279 561 600 votes, and 354 347 910 are B shares, representing the same number of votes. Beijer Ref&rsquo;s share capital and the share&rsquo;s quota value are unchanged because of this conversion.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span>In connection with a conversion, the company has an obligation under the Act (1991: 980) on trading in financial instruments to publish information about the change in this way.</span></span></span></span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>To further strengthen its position in Oceania, Beijer Ref has acquired the assets of the Australian company, Industrial Refrigeration Components (IRC). Beijer Ref has also entered into an exclusive cooperation agreement for the distribution of LU-VE products. LU-VE is one of Beijer Ref&rsquo;s partners in heat exchangers, in Australia and New Zealand. The agreements complement Beijer Ref&rsquo;s strategy when it comes to focusing on natural refrigeration technology.</p>

<p>Beijer Ref will also expand its portfolio in these markets, to include ammonia units (NH3) via SCM Ref Australia, Beijer Ref Australia&rsquo;s manufacturing operation. Ammonia is one of several refrigerants for environmentally friendly technology.</p>

<p>The investment means that Beijer Ref will strengthen its ability to meet the overall need that&nbsp;exist in the local industrial market &ndash; with a complete set of industrial products and components.</p>

<p>As part of the agreement, Australian customers will have the opportunity, via Beijer Ref&nbsp;Australia and SCM Ref Australia, to buy LU-VE products, as well as take part in a wide range of specialized industrial components.</p>

<p>Per Bertland, CEO Beijer Ref, comments:<br />
&ldquo;This is a very positive development. Our customers can now conveniently take part in Beijer Ref&rsquo;s wide range of products, both when it comes to commercial, industrial as well as natural refrigerant solutions, while being supported by our Australian branch network.&rdquo;</p>

<p>IRC has an annual turnover of approximately SEK 20 million, and the company consists of two employees. IRC will be integrated into Beijer Ref Australia&rsquo;s current organization and has a minor influence on the company&rsquo;s earnings and position.</p>

I am very pleased to hand over the CEO role to Christopher and will continue to fully support Beijer Ref and Christopher through the Board of Directors.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span style="vertical-align:middle"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span><span style="color:black">In connection with a conversion, the company has an obligation under the Act (1991: 980) on trading in financial instruments to publish information about the change in this way.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span style="vertical-align:middle"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span><span style="color:black">As a result of the share split (3: 1) decided by the Annual General Meeting of Beijer Ref on April 15, 2021, the number of shares in Beijer Ref has increased by 254,869,380.

&nbsp;
<p><span><span><span style="color:black"><strong><span style="font-size:10pt"><span>First quarter</span></span></strong></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span>Net sales increased by 7.3% in the first quarter compared to the same period last year and amounted to SEK 3,731 million (3,478). Organic growth was strong at 7.3%. Acquisition effects amounted to 5.1%, which is offset by currency effects amounting to -5.2%. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span>EBITDA amounted to SEK 377 million (309), corresponding to an EBITDA margin of 10.1% (8.9%). The operating profit for the quarter amounted to SEK 263 million (197), an increase of 33% compared with the previous year. The operating margin amounted to 7.0% (5.7%). </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span>Profit before tax was SEK 248 million (182). Net financial items are in line with previous year despite </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span>increased borrowings in connection with completed acquisitions and costs for the granted credit capacity.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span>Cash flow from current activities was positive during the quarter and amounted to SEK 323 million (218). The company&#039;s liquidity remained good during the quarter and the company&#039;s balance sheet is strong, with unutilised credit amounting to SEK 1,608 million (1,383).</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span>Profit per share before and after dilution amounted to SEK 1.42 (1.05) and SEK 1.41 (1.05) respectively, which is an increase of 35%.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span>At the end of 2020, the acquisition of 85% of the shares of Sinclair in the Czech Republic was completed, which is included in the group&#039;s financial statements from 1 January 2021. During the first quarter of 2021, the acquisition of all shares of Complete Air Supply in Australia and 60% of the shares of Coolair in Germany was concluded; these are included in the company&#039;s accounts from February and March 2021 respectively. In total, these companies have annual sales of approximately SEK 650 million and strengthen the group&#039;s operating margin. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span>Covid-19 has had a small effect on the company&#039;s results during the first quarter. The savings programme that was implemented in 2020 has led to cost savings of approximately SEK 20 million during the first quarter. The company does not expect any major impact on earnings related to Covid-19 in 2021 unless new unforeseen outbreaks occur.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span>The company&#039;s CEO Per Bertland announced his resignation in the first quarter and the recruitment of a successor is ongoing and is expected to be completed after summer 2021. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span>The company has also signed a new partnership agreement with Bitzer in Germany, which is an important supplier of compressors to the company. Beijer Ref and Bitzer are among the leaders in the refrigeration and air conditioning industry and have extended their partnership agreement for a further three years.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom:11px"><span><span style="font-size:10pt"><span>The annual general meeting was held on 15 April 2021 and the meeting decided, in accordance with the board&#039;s proposal, on a dividend totalling SEK 3.00, divided into SEK 1.80 with payment in April and SEK 1.20 with payment in October. The meeting also decided to perform a share split 3:1 with 26 April 2021 as the record date. The meeting also decided to introduce a long-term share-based incentive programme LTIP 2021/2024 for key employees in the group. In accordance with the board&#039;s proposal, it was decided to offer the participants in LTIP 2018/21 repurchase of purchase options.</span></span></span></p>

<p align="left" style="text-align:left"><span><span style="font-size:18pt"><span><span style="color:#1e2736">Comments by the CEO</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="color:black"><strong><span style="font-size:14pt"><span>Organic growth</span></span></strong></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span>The first quarter of the year was strong and a clear sign of recovery. Sales amounted to SEK 3.7 billion, an increase of 7.3% compared to the same period last year and our best Q1 report ever.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span>Organic growth in the quarter amounted to 7.3%, which is a statement of strength, given that several of our markets are still partially closed down. This shows that our products and our offering, which have a societal function, are also in demand in the present circumstances. My assessment is that there is a pent-up need for our products on the market and that in the coming quarters there will be an increased demand for repair and maintenance work which has not been performed, provided that the restrictions are gradually lifted and we move towards normalisation.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span>The organic growth has a positive effect on operating profit, but the improvement in profit is also a result of the adjustments we have made in the form of efficiency improvements, which have resulted in cost savings.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span>Of the geographical markets, southern Europe stands out with organic sales growth of 17%. Asia Pacific has also had a strong quarter with organic growth of 10%. In terms of our product areas, HVAC accounts for the largest sales increase with organic growth of 15% in the quarter. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span>The OEM product area is in an expansive phase and growth was double digits during the period, especially with the environmentally-friendly product range. Beijer Ref&#039;s new production facility in Padua, Italy, has produced its first units and the group&#039;s total OEM capacity for sustainable production is now twice as large as before. This gives us a strong position in the market when the refrigeration systems of Europe and the rest of the world are to be gradually converted to become sustainable. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span>After ten quarters of falling purchase prices for refrigerants, which has had a sharp negative impact on earnings, the trend is that prices have started to rise, which means that the impact on earnings in the first quarter is marginal. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span>Beijer Ref is driven by creating growth, both organically and through acquisitions. During the period, we have consolidated our most recently added companies &ndash; the Czech company Sinclair, Complete Air Supply in Australia and Coolair in Germany &ndash; with good results. Our strong cash flow enables an even greater focus on acquisitions in the future. We continuously evaluate potential acquisitions in both existing and new markets. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span>At the end of last year, EQT became the new principal owner and the board was given a partly new composition. This gives Beijer Ref good conditions to continue its successful journey, which means that we will continue to have a strong focus on acquisitions, ESG matters and digitalisation. E-commerce is growing continuously and during the first quarter it amounted to approximately 9%. I am optimistic about achieving our long-term goal of e-commerce making up at least 20% of our total sales by 2023.&nbsp; </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span>As I have previously announced, I have chosen to leave my role as CEO in 2021 and instead become a member of the board. The recruitment process for my successor is ongoing. I will remain in position until the new CEO takes office, which hopefully will be sometime after the summer. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span>We have had a good start to the year and I am looking forward to the future. We are a strong team with new principal owners, motivated employees and an offering that is in demand on the market. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span>Megatrends in the form of regulatory provisions and an increased need worldwide for HVAC are putting the wind in our sails. Together with the fact that after the pandemic there is a pent-up need for our products, especially when the HORECA segment also starts to reopen its operations, it gives me every reason to look forward with optimism.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:12pt"><span><span><span style="color:black"><strong><span style="font-size:10pt"><span>Per Bertland</span></span></strong></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span>CEO</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p align="left" style="text-align:left"><span><span style="font-size:18pt"><span><span style="color:#1e2736">First quarter of 2021</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:12pt"><span><span style="color:black"><strong><span style="font-size:9pt"><span><span style="color:#1e2736">NET SALES</span></span></span></strong></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:9pt"><span>Beijer Ref increased its net sales by 7.3 per cent to SEK 3,731 million (3,478) in the first quarter of 2021. Adjusted for exchange rate changes and acquisitions, organic growth in net sales was 7.3 per cent (-3.2). Sales growth has been greatest in air conditioning and OEM as well as in the company&#039;s largest markets in southern Europe. A stronger Swedish krona resulted in negative currency effects of SEK 168 million (41), corresponding to 5.2 per cent (1.2), since most sales are in currencies other than Swedish kronor.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:9pt"><span>The company has experienced growth in all product areas, due to both price and volume increases. Refrigerants have had a less negative effect on sales during the quarter compared to previous quarters.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:9pt"><span>Air conditioning has developed strongly during the quarter and has grown organically by 14.5%, largely thanks to good collaboration with Toshiba, Mitsubishi Heavy, Carrier and Gree. Sales growth in air conditioning has been strong, with the exception of Africa and Eastern Europe.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:9pt"><span>OEM has experienced strong growth in the first quarter, thanks not least to the F-gas phasing-out programme that is underway in Europe. The group has also produced its first units at the new factory in Padua, Italy, doubling its capacity in environmentally-friendly refrigeration technology. The group&#039;s company in China have also had good sales development on the domestic market.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:12pt"><span><span style="color:black"><strong><span style="font-size:9pt"><span><span style="color:#1e2736">PROFIT</span></span></span></strong></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:9pt"><span>The group&rsquo;s operating profit totalled SEK 263 million (197) during the first quarter, which is an increase of 33 per cent (-19). Negative exchange rate effects of SEK 10.3 million (3) are included in the operating profit figures. The operating margin amounted to 7.0 per cent (5.7). The improved profit is due to volume increases, implemented savings and positive acquisition effects.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:9pt"><span>Profit before tax was SEK 248 million (182). Profit for the period totalled SEK 184 million (135). Profit per share before dilution amounted to SEK 1.42 (1.05).</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:12pt"><span><span style="color:black"><strong><span style="font-size:9pt"><span><span style="color:#1e2736">CASH FLOW</span></span></span></strong></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:9pt"><span>Cash flow from current operations before changes in working capital amounted to SEK 323 million in 2021, compared with SEK 218 million in 2020. The change is due to higher earnings during the quarter and less tax paid.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:9pt"><span>Working capital decreased by SEK 13 million during the first quarter compared with an increase of SEK 21 million the previous year. This gives cash flow from current operations of SEK 337 million (197). The change in working capital between the years is due primarily to a lower build-up of stocks during the quarter.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:9pt"><span>At the end of the period, the company had credit facilities amounting to SEK 4,273 million (4,165), of which unutilised credits amounted to SEK 1,608 million (1,383). In total, net liabilities decreased by SEK 314 million. The group has a balanced maturity structure and no loans that fall due in 2021.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:12pt"><span><span style="color:black"><strong><span style="font-size:9pt"><span><span style="color:#1e2736">INVESTMENTS</span></span></span></strong></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:9pt"><span>Cash flow from investment activities amounted to SEK -317 million (-219), which relates primarily to business combinations and investments in fixed assets. Sinclair Global Group, Complete Air Supply and Coolair were acquired during the first quarter (ACD Trade was acquired the previous year). Thanks to the good cash flow, the group has used less of the granted credit capacity and amortised loans by SEK 111 million.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><strong><span style="font-size:9pt"><span><span style="color:#1e2736">COMPANY ACQUISITIONS </span></span></span></strong></span></p>

<p><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:9pt"><span>At the end of 2020, 85% of Sinclair Global Group was acquired and this is included in the group&#039;s financial statements with effect from 1 January 2021. Sinclair is headquartered in Brno in the Czech Republic with sales offices in Slovakia, Hungary and Croatia. Sinclair sells air conditioning and heat pumps to a number of countries and most of the sales consist of HVAC products of its own Sinclair brand. Annual sales amounts to SEK 410M and they have 110 employees.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:9pt"><span>During the first quarter, the company acquired 100% of the shares of Complete Air Supply (CAS) in Australia. This company is active in HVAC and has a range that in particular complements ACD Trade well and which makes what Beijer offers for residential and commercial properties more comprehensive. CAS has annual sales of SEK 140 million, with 40 employees in 2 branches. The company is included in the group&#039;s financial statements with effect from 1 February 2021.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:9pt"><span>Air conditioning is a priority growth area for Beijer Ref and the group is growing steadily in this area both organically and through acquisitions. The growth strategy is strengthened by the acquisition of 60% of the shares of Coolair Klimasysteme GmbH in Germany, which has sales of approximately SEK 100 million and more than 25 employees. The company is included in the group&#039;s financial statements with effect from 1 March 2021 and strengthens Beijer Ref&#039;s presence in Germany, which is a large and important market in Europe.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:12pt"><span><span style="color:black"><strong><span style="font-size:9pt"><span><span style="color:#1e2736">SIGNIFICANT EVENTS DURING AND AFTER THE QUARTER</span></span></span></strong></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:9pt"><span>Beijer Ref is relatively insensitive to economic cycles as about half of the company&#039;s sales are made to end customers active in the food industry. Any decline is offset by the need for the food industry to switch to environmentally friendly systems, which increases the demand for the company&rsquo;s products. This, together with an increased standard of living, is driving our sales development. The company&rsquo;s current assessment is that Covid-19 will have a smaller effect on earnings in 2021. Beijer Ref&rsquo;s assessment is that net savings of approximately SEK 20 million had an effect during the quarter, including support measures of SEK 2 million, but that sales were not significantly affected in 2021.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:9pt"><span>Per Bertland has informed the board of Beijer Ref AB that he will step down as CEO. The transition will take place once a successor has been appointed, which is expected to occur after summer 2021.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:12pt"><span><span style="color:black"><strong><span style="font-size:9pt"><span><span style="color:#1e2736">ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING</span></span></span></strong><strong> </strong></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:9pt"><span>The annual general meeting was held on 15 April 2021. The meeting decided, in accordance with the proposal of the board, on a dividend of SEK 3.00 per share for the 2020 financial year. Of the proposed amount, SEK 2.50 per share corresponds to an ordinary dividend and SEK 0.50 is an extraordinary dividend. Payment of the dividend shall be made in two instalments: the first of SEK 1.80 per share and the second of SEK 1.20 per share (0.40 after split). Total dividend amounts to SEK 379.6M based on total number of outstanding shares. The record dates are 19 April 2021 and 8 October 2021. Payment from Euroclear Sweden AB is expected to be made on 22 April 2021 for the first payment and 13 October 2021 for the second payment. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:9pt"><span>The meeting also decided to perform a share split 3:1 with 26 April 2021 as the record date. The meeting also decided to introduce a long-term share-based incentive programme LTIP 2021/2024 for key employees in the group. In accordance with the board&#039;s proposal, it was decided to offer the participants in LTIP 2018/21 repurchase of purchase options issued in LTIP 2018/2021.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:12pt"><span><span style="color:black"><strong><span style="font-size:9pt"><span><span style="color:#1e2736">THE SHARE</span></span></span></strong></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:9pt"><span>Since 2 January 2019, Beijer Ref&rsquo;s B share has been listed on Nasdaq OMX Stockholm&#039;s Large Cap list. The share capital in Beijer Ref totals SEK 371,685,513, made up of 127,434,690 shares, each with a quota value of SEK 2.92. There are two types of share, A shares and B shares, which represent ten and one votes respectively. Beijer Ref had 11,520 shareholders on 31 March 2021 (9,101). The proportion of foreign shareholders amounts to 4.1% (4.5), corresponding to a capital shareholding of 54.9% (59.6). As of 31 March 2021, there were 9,918,720 class A shares and 117,515,970 class B shares. The company&#039;s ten largest shareholders hold 77.2% (78.6) of the votes and 62.1% (64.5) of the capital. Average sales of the Beijer share in the quarter amounted to 149,369 shares (184,243) per day at an average purchase price of SEK 363 (233). The closing price on 31 March 2021 was SEK 383 (179). As of 31 March 2021, the market value was SEK 48.8 billion (22.8).</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:12pt"><span><span style="color:black"><strong><span style="font-size:9pt"><span><span style="color:#1e2736">RISK DESCRIPTION</span></span></span></strong></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:9pt"><span>Beijer Ref group&#039;s operations are affected by a number of external factors whose effects on the group&#039;s operating profit can be monitored to varying degrees. The group&#039;s operations depend on general economic developments in Europe in particular, which govern demand for Beijer Ref&#039;s products and services. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:9pt"><span>Like other global companies, Beijer Ref is affected by pandemics and in 2020 the group was affected by Covid-19. The company&rsquo;s assessment is that Covid-19 is having a smaller effect on earnings in 2021. The company is taking the necessary steps to reduce its impact and is following the WHO recommendations.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:9pt"><span>Acquisitions are normally associated with risks, such as loss of key personnel. Other operating risks, such as agency and supplier agreements, product liability and delivery commitments, technical development, guarantees, dependence on individuals etcetera, are continuously analysed. If necessary, measures are taken to reduce the group&#039;s risk exposure. In its operations, Beijer Ref is exposed to financial risks such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk and liquidity risk. The parent company&#039;s risk pattern is the same as that of the group. For further information, see the group&#039;s annual report.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:12pt"><span><span style="color:black"><strong><span style="font-size:9pt"><span><span style="color:#1e2736">ACCOUNTING POLICIES</span></span></span></strong></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:9pt"><span>This interim report was prepared in accordance with IAS 34, the Swedish Annual Accounts Act and RFR 2. Beijer Ref continues to apply the same accounting policies and valuation methods as described in the most recent annual report. Information pursuant to IAS 34.16A, in addition to disclosure in the financial reports and their associated notes, also appears in other parts of the interim report.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size:12pt"><span><span style="color:black"><em><span style="font-size:9pt"><span>Financial assets and liabilities by category and level of valuation</span></span></em></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:9pt"><span>The group&#039;s financial assets and liabilities consist of financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income and financial assets and liabilities valued at accrued acquisition value. </span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:9pt"><span>Financial assets valued at fair value through other comprehensive income consist of three holdings, one of which (SEK 15M) refers to listed shares and is valued at market value on the balance sheet date (valuation level 1). The two other holdings (SEK 29M) is unlisted holdings and is valued at estimated fair value (valuation level 3). Financial assets valued at accrued acquisition value, such as trade receivables and other receivables, as well as cash and cash equivalents, amount to SEK 4,049M on the balance sheet date and financial liabilities valued at accrued acquisition value such as accounts payable, leasing liabilities and borrowings, as well as other long-term liabilities, amount to SEK 7,165M.</span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:9pt"><span>Financial interest-bearing liabilities such as loans linked to financing are entered at accrued acquisition value and are considered to constitute a good estimate of fair value taking into account the fixed terms and the setting of interest rates.</span></span></span></span></p>

The call options may be exercised 1-30 June 2021. The Board of Directors proposes to offer to repurchase up to all call options as per 31 May 2021, at a purchase price corresponding to per option the volume weighted average share price paid on Nasdaq Stockholm during the period 24-28 May 2021 less the exercise price, subject to a requirement that the participant will subscribe in full to the participant’s offer in the LTIP 2021/2024 program. Should all participants accept the repurchase offer, the cash flow associated with the repurchase amounts to maximum SEK 186 million, based on a share price of SEK 365. The background to the proposal is that it is considered more cost-effective for the company to repurchase call options of the LTIP 2018/2021 program than to repurchase new shares to secure the delivery of shares under the LTIP 2021/2024 program. Beijer Ref thus intends to retain the shares repurchased to secure delivery under the LTIP 2018/2021 program to secure future incentive programs and that the repurchase of additional shares to secure the delivery of shares under the LTIP 2021/2024 program can thus be limited to a corresponding extent.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>Beijer Ref has confirmed their successful collaboration with Embraco and extended their partnership agreement for another three years. </strong>

Embraco is a brand in Nidec Global Appliance’s portfolio and has since 1971 been a global provider of refrigeration technology to the domestic and commercial cold chain.

The contract means that both parties will be able to strengthen their position in Europe, increase their growth in Oceania as well as develop the commercial refrigeration distribution in South Africa. This reinforces the long-term business growth for Beijer Ref and Embraco.

Embraco’s brand portfolio for commercial refrigeration is sold in more than 80 countries. The Beijer Ref Group has 70 subsidiaries and approximately 450 branches in 37 countries.

Christopher Norbye, CEO Beijer Ref, comments:

“<em>We are pleased to further expand our long-standing partnership with Embraco. This successful collaboration allows us to strengthen our position in Europe and provide refrigeration installation contractors, service companies and contracting companies with an extensive product portfolio.”</em>

Daniel Campos, Sales &amp; Marketing Vice President at Nidec Global Appliance, comments:

“<em>We want to offer the most complete product portfolio. In a period of supply chain complexity, Beijer Ref is the perfect partner for improving our presence to the final customer.”</em>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="margin-bottom:8pt;margin-top:12px"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:11pt"><strong>As of today, Beijer Ref has signed an agreement to acquire 51 percent of the shares in the Australian air conditioning company AAD (Australian Airconditioning Distributors Pty Ltd) and HVAC Consolidated (HVAC Consolidated Pty Ltd), with the option to acquire the remaining shares. </strong></span></p>

<p style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;margin-bottom:8pt;margin-top:0pt;text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:11pt">During the Australian financial year, which ended on 30 June 2022, AAD and HVAC Consolidated had a combined turnover of approximately SEK 800 million with good profitability. Sellers of AAD and HVAC Consolidated, and holders of the remaining 49 percent in each company, are Aircon Concepts Pty Ltd and Coldflow Airconditioning Pty Ltd. Completion of the transaction is expected to take place on November 1, 2022.</span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom:8pt;margin-top:0pt;text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:11pt">AAD and HVAC Consolidated are based in Melbourne, Australia, with AAD having geographical coverage in three states. The companies, together, have established relationships with international manufacturers within air conditioning, as well as a broad product portfolio with the AAD brand. Beijer Ref, AAD and HVAC Consolidated will together expand their current product portfolio and create synergies within purchasing.</span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom:8pt;margin-top:0pt;text-align:justify"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:11pt">AAD will continue to operate under its own brand, in both distribution and marketing. The acquisition will have a positive impact on the Beijer Ref Group&rsquo;s results and position. AAD and HVAC Consolidated have approximately 125 employees.</span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom:8pt;margin-top:0pt"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:11pt">Christopher Norbye, CEO Beijer Ref, comments:</span><br>
<span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:11pt"><em>&rdquo;The acquisition of AAD and HVAC Consolidated aligns with our growth strategy and complements our existing offering in Australia well. AAD has very good conditions for continued strong growth and we look forward to developing the companies together with the existing owners.&rdquo;</em></span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom:8pt;margin-top:0pt"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:11pt">The purchase price, for 51 percent of the shares, amounts to approximately SEK 480 million on a debt-free basis and the acquisition is financed via cash and existing credit facilities.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="margin-top:12px"><span>&quot;We began the year strongly with organic sales increase of 16 per cent. All of our geographical segments had positive developments and we report total sales growth of 31 per cent compared with the same period last year. Our southern hemisphere markets had a good summer season and the acquisitions in Asia Pacific (APAC) show good growth&quot;, says Christopher Norbye, CEO Beijer Ref.</span></p>

<p><strong><span>FIRST QUARTER</span></strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><span>Organic sales rose 15.8 per cent in the quarter compared to the previous year. Acquisition effects were 10.0 per cent and currency effects were 5.6 per cent. Net sales increased by 31.4 per cent to SEK 4,903 million (3,731).</span><br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li><span>EBITA amounted to SEK 407 million (275), which is an increase of 48,3 per cent over the same period last year. The EBITA margin amounted to 8.3 per cent (7.4). This is Beijer Ref&rsquo;s best ever first quarter, in absolute terms.</span><br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li><span>Operating cash flow has been negative during the quarter and was -295 (386). Cash flow has been affected by the higher business activity during the quarter, as well as by a conscious increased service level on inventory ahead of the coming peak season.</span><br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li><span>Profit per share was SEK 0.71 (0.47), which is an increase of 49.4 per cent.</span><br>
	&nbsp;</li>
	<li><span>During the quarter, an acquisition of 80 per cent of the shares in Deltron in Croatia was completed, with an option to acquire the remaining shares. The company has annual sales of approximately SEK 400 million with good profitability. At the end of the quarter, two small supplementary acquisitions were also made in Australia.</span></li>

The program includes approximately 120 executives in the Beijer Ref Group, who are given the opportunity to acquire a maximum of 1,616,000 call options at a market price from Beijer Ref. Each call option entitles the holder to acquire from the company one (1) B share in the company during the period of 15 May 2025 until 15 June 2025. The exercise price per share shall be 125 percent of the volume-weighted average price paid for the company&rsquo;s share on Nasdaq Stockholm during five trading days immediately before the transfer of the call options to the participants.

The issue can take place with or without deviation from the shareholders&rsquo; preferential rights, by payment in cash, non-cash or set-off. The purpose of the authorization, and the reason for the deviation from the shareholders&rsquo; preferential rights, is to fulfill the company&rsquo;s acquisition strategy by enabling acquisitions through payment in Beijer Ref shares (non-cash issue) or flexibility in the financing of acquisitions. The issue price must be determined according to market conditions, which may include customary discounts.</span></p>

The intent is to exercise the authorisation only to the extent needed for the Scheme. Acquisitions shall take place at Nasdaq Stockholm in accordance with the stock exchange&rsquo;s regulations at a price within the price range registered at any time, which means the range between the highest buy rate and the lowest sell rate.

However, before any transfers of Beijer Ref shares to participants in LTI 2022/2025 can be made, the Board of Directors intends to propose to a later General Meetings to resolve on transfers of the Company&rsquo;s own shares on a regulated marked in order to hedge such payments.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span style="font-size:10pt"><span><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">The costs of the Scheme consist of the subsidy that may be paid in connection with the transfer of the call options as described above, the social security contributions incurred for this subsidy and the cost of financing the repurchased shares. The total cost for the subsidy is estimated to be approximately SEK 17,471,000 (before corporate tax, and SEK 13,103,250 after corporate tax) over the term of the Scheme. Against the subsidy, the option premium corresponds to a total of approximately SEK 27,633,600, which the Company receives for the sale and transfer of the call options. The Company&rsquo;s financing cost for the repurchase of shares is estimated to be approximately SEK 5,524,514 after corporate tax. All information is calculated based on a share price of SEK 145. Other costs mainly relates to calculated social security contributions, which are hedged through the repurchase of shares.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span style="font-size:10pt"><span><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">During its term, the Scheme will have a positive effect on the key indicator &ldquo;profit per share&rdquo; because of the Company&rsquo;s repurchasing of shares and a negative effect on the same key indicator because of the costs described above. The net effect on the key indicator &ldquo;profit per share&rdquo; will be insignificant during the term of the Scheme and will disappear entirely after its conclusion. Otherwise it is also assessed that the Scheme will have only an insignificant effect on important key indicators.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span style="font-size:10pt"><span><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Reason for the Scheme and its preparation </span></span></span></strong></span></span><br>
<span><span><span style="font-size:10pt"><span><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">The Board of Directors&rsquo; reason for the implementation of the Scheme is to provide executives within the Beijer Ref Group the opportunity through a personal investment to take part in and strive to achieve a positive value growth in the Company&rsquo;s shares and thereby achieve a greater shared interest between them and the Company&rsquo;s shareholders. The intention of the Scheme is also to contribute to executives in the long term increasing their shareholding in the Company. The Scheme is also expected to create conditions for retaining and recruiting competent personnel in the Beijer Ref Group, to provide competitive compensation and to unite the interests of shareholders and executives. The Board of Directors considers the Scheme to be reasonable in its scope and cost-efficiency. The executives covered by the Scheme is the group that, in an otherwise strongly decentralised organisation, has an opportunity to create a positive impact on profits through collaboration between the Group&rsquo;s subsidiaries. Against this background, the Board of Directors believes that the introduction of the Scheme will have a positive effect on the Beijer Ref Group&rsquo;s continued development and that the Scheme will be of benefit to both the shareholders and the Company. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span style="font-size:10pt"><span><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">The proposal for the Scheme has been prepared by the Company&rsquo;s Remuneration Committee and the Board of Directors. The decision to propose the Scheme to the Annual General Meeting was made by the Board of Directors. Members of the Company&rsquo;s Board of Directors are not covered by the Scheme. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span style="font-size:10pt"><span><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Majority requirement</span></span></span></strong></span></span><br>
<span><span><span style="font-size:10pt"><span><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">The Board of Directors&rsquo; proposal in accordance with points (A)-(C) above shall be adopted as a joint resolution under application of the majority rules in Chapter 16 of the Swedish Companies Act, which means that shareholders with at least nine tenths of both votes submitted, and shares represented at the Meeting must vote for the resolution.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

As compared to the current guidelines, the guidelines now include a possibility to apply non-financial criteria for variable cash remuneration and have also been adjusted by reason of the Board of Directs having established a Remuneration Committee.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="text-align:justify"><span><strong style="font-weight:bold"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">The Board of Directors&rsquo; proposal for guidelines for executive remuneration</span></span></strong></span><br>
<span><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">The CEO and President of the Beijer Ref Group and individuals who are members of the Group Management of Beijer Ref AB (the &ldquo;company&rdquo; or &ldquo;Beijer Ref&rdquo;) during the period of which these guidelines are in force, fall within the provisions of these guidelines. These guidelines shall apply to remuneration agreed, and amendments to remuneration already agreed, after adoption of the guidelines by the Annual General Meeting 2022. The guidelines do not apply to any remuneration specifically decided by the general meeting, such as remuneration to board members or share-related incentive schemes. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

Beijer Ref has an expressed mission &ndash; to provide the market with global expertise in refrigeration and air conditioning. By growing more quickly than the market, the goal is to strengthen the position as a world-leading organisation. To do this, the group works according to a strategy that is divided into five focus areas &ndash; acquisition, OEM, purchasing &amp; logistics, digitalisation and sustainability. A prerequisite for the successful implementation of Beijer Ref&rsquo;s business strategy and safeguarding of its long-term interests, including its sustainability, is that the company is able to recruit and retain qualified personnel. The objective of Beijer Ref&rsquo;s remuneration policy for senior executives is therefore to offer competitive remuneration on market terms, in order to attract, motivate and retain competent and skilled employees. These guidelines enable the company to offer senior executives a competitive total remuneration.

Fulfilment of criteria for payment of variable cash remuneration shall be measured during a one year period. CEO obtains an amount corresponding to a maximum of 55% of the annual salary and other senior executives obtains an amount corresponding to a maximum of 50% of the annual salary. Variable cash remuneration shall not qualify for pension benefits. The variable cash remuneration shall be linked to predetermined, well-defined and measurable financial and non-financial criteria for the Beijer Ref Group and on group and individual level, respectively, such as growth of revenue, growth of profit and working capital development and, with regard to the non-financial criteria, be linked to clear functional targets and/or sustainability targets. Weighting is done relatively between the different criteria based on which focus shall be given to the executive management; the primary weight is to be placed on growth of profit. The non-financial criteria may apply to a maximum of 20 percent of the total variable cash remuneration. The criteria shall be designed so as to contribute to Beijer Ref&rsquo;s business strategy and long-term interests, including its sustainability, by for example being linked to the business strategy or promote the senior executive&rsquo;s long-term development within Beijer Ref. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Further variable cash remuneration may be awarded in extraordinary circumstances, provided that such extraordinary arrangements are limited in time and only made on an individual basis, either for the purpose of recruiting or retaining senior executives, or as remuneration for extraordinary performance beyond the individual&rsquo;s ordinary tasks. Such remuneration may not exceed an amount corresponding to 100 per cent of the fixed annual cash salary and may not be paid more than once each year per individual.

<span><span style="font-size:11pt"><span><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">In order to secure Beijer Ref&rsquo;s delivery of shares to the participants in the Schemes and possible future incentive programs and, in terms of liquidity, hedge payments of future social security contributions related to delivery of shares, the Board of Directors proposes that the Annual General Meeting shall pass a resolution to authorise the Board of Directors to acquire up to 1,319,362 class B shares in the Company before the 2023 Annual General Meeting. The intent is to exercise the authorisation only to the extent needed for the Scheme. Acquisitions shall take place at Nasdaq Stockholm in accordance with the stock exchange&rsquo;s regulations at a price within the price range registered at any time, which means the range between the highest buy rate and the lowest sell rate. Acquisitions shall be paid for in cash and may take place on one or more occasions</span></span></span><span style="font-size:10pt"><span><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<span><span><span style="font-size:10pt"><span><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">The Board of Directors&rsquo; proposal also includes that the Annual General Meeting shall approve that the Board of Directors, with deviation from the preferential rights of shareholders, may transfer up to 1,616,000 of the Company&rsquo;s class B shares to participants in the Schemes following exercise of the call options, in accordance with the terms of the call options. The reason for the deviation from the preferential rights of shareholders is to give Beijer Ref the opportunity to deliver shares in the Company to the participants in the Schemes and possible future incentive programs.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span style="font-size:10pt"><span><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Since the initiation of LTI 2022/2025 is not expected to give rise to any costs for social security contributions of Beijer Ref (and since a resolution on transfer is valid only until the next Annual General Meeting), the Board of Directors has decided not to propose that the Annual General Meeting 2022 resolves on transfer of the Company&rsquo;s own shares on a regulated market for in terms of liquidity, hedge payments of future social security contributions. However, before any transfers of Beijer Ref shares to participants in LTI 2022/2025 can be made, the Board of Directors intends to propose to a later General Meetings to resolve on transfers of the Company&rsquo;s own shares on a regulated marked in order to hedge such payments.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<span><span><span style="font-size:10pt"><span><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">The Scheme does not involve any dilution for existing shareholders as it is based on call options in respect of shares already issued in the Company. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span style="font-size:10pt"><span><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">The costs of the Scheme consist of the subsidy that may be paid in connection with the transfer of the call options as described above, the social security contributions incurred for this subsidy and the cost of financing the repurchased shares. The total cost for the subsidy is estimated to be approximately SEK 17,471,000 (before corporate tax, and SEK 13,103,250 after corporate tax) over the term of the Scheme. Against the subsidy, the option premium corresponds to a total of approximately SEK 27,633,600, which the Company receives for the sale and transfer of the call options. The Company&rsquo;s financing cost for the repurchase of shares is estimated to be approximately SEK 5,524,514 after corporate tax. All information is calculated based on a share price of SEK 145. Other costs mainly relates to calculated social security contributions, which are hedged through the repurchase of shares.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span style="font-size:10pt"><span><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">During its term, the Scheme will have a positive effect on the key indicator &ldquo;profit per share&rdquo; because of the Company&rsquo;s repurchasing of shares and a negative effect on the same key indicator because of the costs described above. The net effect on the key indicator &ldquo;profit per share&rdquo; will be insignificant during the term of the Scheme and will disappear entirely after its conclusion. Otherwise it is also assessed that the Scheme will have only an insignificant effect on important key indicators.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<span><span><span style="font-size:10pt"><span><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">In order to secure delivery of shares and to cover administrative costs, mainly costs for social security contributions, the Board of Directors proposes to resolve on repurchase of shares, and to resolve on transfer of shares to participants in LTI 2022/2025 in accordance with section B and C above.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span style="font-size:10pt"><span><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Other share based incentive programs</span></span></span></strong></span></span><br>

LTI 2021/2024 is in all major respects similar to LTI 2022/2025, as proposed, and currently includes call options for 1,476,000 class B shares at an exercise price of SEK 165.60 per share. The Schemes jointly corresponds to 0,81 per cent of the shares of the Company and 0,49 per cent of the votes, but entail no dilution for existing shareholders.&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span style="font-size:10pt"><span><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Reason for the Scheme and its preparation </span></span></span></strong></span></span><br>
<span><span><span style="font-size:10pt"><span><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">The Board of Directors&rsquo; reason for the implementation of the Scheme is to provide executives within the Beijer Ref Group the opportunity through a personal investment to take part in and strive to achieve a positive value growth in the Company&rsquo;s shares and thereby achieve a greater shared interest between them and the Company&rsquo;s shareholders. The intention of the Scheme is also to contribute to executives in the long term increasing their shareholding in the Company. The Scheme is also expected to create conditions for retaining and recruiting competent personnel in the Beijer Ref Group, to provide competitive compensation and to unite the interests of shareholders and executives. The Board of Directors considers the Scheme to be reasonable in its scope and cost-efficiency. The executives covered by the Scheme is the group that, in an otherwise strongly decentralised organisation, has an opportunity to create a positive impact on profits through collaboration between the Group&rsquo;s subsidiaries. Against this background, the Board of Directors believes that the introduction of the Scheme will have a positive effect on the Beijer Ref Group&rsquo;s continued development and that the Scheme will be of benefit to both the shareholders and the Company. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span style="font-size:10pt"><span><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">The proposal for the Scheme has been prepared by the Company&rsquo;s Remuneration Committee and the Board of Directors. The decision to propose the Scheme to the Annual General Meeting was made by the Board of Directors. Members of the Company&rsquo;s Board of Directors are not covered by the Scheme. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><strong><span style="font-size:10pt"><span><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Majority requirement</span></span></span></strong></span></span><br>
<span><span><span style="font-size:10pt"><span><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">The Board of Directors&rsquo; proposal in accordance with points (A)-(C) above shall be adopted as a joint resolution under application of the majority rules in Chapter 16 of the Swedish Companies Act, which means that shareholders with at least nine tenths of both votes submitted, and shares represented at the Meeting must vote for the resolution.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

As compared to the current guidelines, the guidelines now include a possibility to apply non-financial criteria for variable cash remuneration and have also been adjusted by reason of the Board of Directs having established a Remuneration Committee.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

These guidelines shall apply to remuneration agreed, and amendments to remuneration already agreed, after adoption of the guidelines by the Annual General Meeting 2022. The guidelines do not apply to any remuneration specifically decided by the general meeting, such as remuneration to board members or share-related incentive schemes. </span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

Beijer Ref has an expressed mission &ndash; to provide the market with global expertise in refrigeration and air conditioning. By growing more quickly than the market, the goal is to strengthen the position as a world-leading organisation. To do this, the group works according to a strategy that is divided into five focus areas &ndash; acquisition, OEM, purchasing &amp; logistics, digitalisation and sustainability. A prerequisite for the successful implementation of Beijer Ref&rsquo;s business strategy and safeguarding of its long-term interests, including its sustainability, is that the company is able to recruit and retain qualified personnel. The objective of Beijer Ref&rsquo;s remuneration policy for senior executives is therefore to offer competitive remuneration on market terms, in order to attract, motivate and retain competent and skilled employees. These guidelines enable the company to offer senior executives a competitive total remuneration.

The company is headquartered in Split (Croatia) and has an annual turnover of approximately SEK 400 million, with a good profitability.</strong></span></p><p style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:12px"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:12pt">Deltron was founded in 1995 and their main business consists of air conditioning equipment for commercial and private use. In 2014, Deltron established a subsidiary in Sarajevo (Bosnia and Herzegovina) that in recent years has experienced strong and profitable sales growth. Beijer Ref already has a minor presence in Croatia and will, through this acquisition, also establish presence in Bosnia and Herzegovina, which is a new market for the group.</span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="margin-top: 12px"><span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong>First quarter</strong></span></p>

<ul>
 	<li><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Organic sales increased 14.5 per cent in the quarter compared to the previous year. Acquisition effects amounted to 30.2 per cent and currency effects were 5.8 per cent. Net sales increased by 50.5 per cent and amounted to SEK 7,378 million (4,903).</span></span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">EBITA amounted to SEK 702 million (407), which is an increase of 72.4 per cent compared to the same period last year. The EBITA margin amounted to 9.5 per cent (8.3).</span></span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">This is Beijer Ref’s best first quarter ever, excluding items affecting comparability, in both absolute terms and margin, based on the current structure.</span></span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">The first quarter includes non-recurring costs related to the temporary financing regarding the acquisition of the North American operation Heritage Distribution of SEK 138 million, which is reported under the item “Net financial income/expense”.</span></span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Operating cash flow amounted to SEK -209 million (-295) during the quarter. Operating cash flow in the quarter was still affected by the effects of the unstable supply chain in 2022.</span></span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">Profit per share after dilution, and adjusted for items affecting comparability in the net financial income/expense, amounted to SEK 1.08 (0.65), which is an increase of 66.6 per cent.</span></span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">The previously announced acquisitions of the HVACR company Heritage Distribution (North America), as well as Transport Cooling (South Africa) were completed in the first quarter. Heritage Distribution was completed and consolidated per January 20.</span></span></li>
 	<li><span style="font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size: 10pt">The announced rights issue was completed during the quarter. The rights issue was subscribed to 99.7 per cent with the support of subscription rights. Other shares were allotted to those who subscribed for shares without subscription rights. Overall, the rights issue was oversubscribed by 44 per cent.</span></span></li>
</ul>
<span style="font-size: 10pt"><strong>CEO comments</strong></span>

<span style="font-size: 10pt">During the first quarter, we have continued to build on the success of 2022. All markets have shown positive growth and total sales amounted to SEK 7,378 million, which is an increase of 50 per cent over the same period last year, with organic growth of 15 per cent. Operating profit (EBITA) amounted to SEK 702 million, which is an increase of 72 per cent compared to the same period last year. All segments recorded strong organic growth: HVAC 17 per cent, OEM 24 per cent and Commercial and Industrial Refrigeration 10 per cent.</span>

<span style="font-size: 10pt">During the quarter, we continued to have good demand for air/air (AC products), primarily for heating. Increased awareness of energy efficiency and improved indoor environments are contributing factors. Also, the rising electricity prices in Europe have led to more and more people starting to see the cost benefits of using air/air as a complement to heating.</span>

<span style="font-size: 10pt">We continue to focus on creating simple and seamless e-commerce experiences for our customers, resulting in increased sales and customer satisfaction. During the quarter, our digital sales continued their very good growth and we have had good development on both existing and new e-commerce platforms. Sales increased by 40 per cent, compared with the same period last year.</span>

<span style="font-size: 10pt">Uncertain supply chains are something the industry is still struggling with and which have had a negative impact on our warehouse stocks; we continue to see improvements, especially regarding lead times for products and components. We expect a normalisation of warehouse stocks, adjusted for our seasonal variations, in the second half of 2023.</span>

<span style="font-size: 10pt">I am pleased to inform that during the quarter (January 20) we completed the acquisition of the North American HVAC company Heritage Distribution, subject to customary completion conditions. This acquisition is an important step for Beijer Ref and reflects our commitment to expanding our global reach and meeting the needs of our customers in all corners of the world. Heritage Distribution has been integrated in line with our expectations and reported good development in the first quarter. The integration of AAD (Australia) has also gone according to plan.</span>

<span style="font-size: 10pt">The Beijer Ref Exchange Programme for 2023 has been concluded. The programme has enabled participants to gain valuable insights from other parts of the organisation, learn new skills and build relationships with colleagues from different countries. A big thank you to all participants whose contributions have been crucial to the success of the program.</span>

<span style="font-size: 10pt">Finally, I would like to take this opportunity to welcome Heritage Distribution to the Beijer Ref family. They have an ambitious and dedicated team that brings many years of industry experience. Europe and the North America are now moving towards their summer season and, with a well thought-out strategy behind us and purposeful employees, we continue to create good conditions for long-term growth.</span>

Acquisitions shall take place at Nasdaq Stockholm in accordance with Nasdaq Stockholm&rsquo;s rulebook at a price within the price range registered at any time, which means the range between the highest buy rate and the lowest sell rate.

The reason for the deviation from the preferential rights of shareholders is to give Beijer Ref the opportunity to deliver shares in the Company to the participants in the Scheme and possible future incentive programs.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:9pt"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Since the initiation of LTI 2023/2026 is not expected to give rise to any costs for social security contributions of Beijer Ref (and since a resolution on transfer is valid only until the next Annual General Meeting), the Board of Directors has decided not to propose that the Annual General Meeting 2023 resolves on transfer of the Company&rsquo;s own shares on a regulated market for in terms of liquidity, hedge payments of future social security contributions. However, before any transfers of Beijer Ref shares to participants in LTI 2023/2026 can be made, the Board of Directors intends to propose to a later General Meetings to resolve on transfers of the Company&rsquo;s own shares on a regulated marked in order to hedge such payments.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:9pt"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">The Scheme does not involve any dilution for existing shareholders as it is based on call options in respect of shares already issued in the Company. The costs of the Scheme consist of the subsidy that will be paid in connection with the transfer of the call options as described above, the social security contributions incurred for this subsidy and the cost of financing the repurchased shares. The total cost for the subsidy is estimated to be approximately SEK 18,315,000 (before corporate tax, and SEK 12,591,562 after corporate tax) over the term of the Scheme. Against the subsidy, the option premium corresponds to a total of approximately SEK 36,630,000, which the Company receives for the sale and transfer of the call options. All information is calculated based on a share price of SEK 164. The Company&rsquo;s financing cost for the repurchase of shares is estimated to be approximately SEK 291,816,000 after corporate tax. Other costs mainly relate to calculated social security contributions, which are hedged through the repurchase of shares.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:9pt"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">During its term, the Scheme will have a positive effect on the key indicator profit per share because of the Company&rsquo;s repurchasing of shares and a negative effect on the same key indicator because of the costs described above. The net effect on the key indicator profit per share will be insignificant during the term of the Scheme and will disappear entirely after its conclusion. Otherwise, it is also assessed that the Scheme will have only an insignificant effect on important key indicators.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:9pt"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">The Board of Directors&rsquo; reason for the implementation of the Scheme is to provide executives within the Beijer Ref Group the opportunity through a personal investment to take part in and strive to achieve a positive value growth in the Company&rsquo;s shares and thereby achieve a greater shared interest between them and the Company&rsquo;s shareholders. The intention of the Scheme is also to contribute to executives in the long term increasing their shareholding in the Company. The Scheme is also expected to create conditions for retaining and recruiting competent personnel in the Beijer Ref Group, to provide competitive compensation and to unite the interests of shareholders and executives. The Board of Directors considers the Scheme to be reasonable in its scope and cost-efficiency. The executives covered by the Scheme is the group that, in an otherwise strongly decentralised organisation, has an opportunity to create a positive impact on profits through collaboration between the Group&rsquo;s subsidiaries. Against this background, the Board of Directors believes that the introduction of the Scheme will have a positive effect on the Beijer Ref Group&rsquo;s continued development and that the Scheme will be of benefit to both the shareholders and the Company. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:9pt"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">The proposal for the Scheme has been prepared by the Company&rsquo;s Remuneration Committee and the Board of Directors.

These guidelines shall apply to remuneration agreed, and amendments to remuneration already agreed, after adoption of the guidelines by the Annual General Meeting 2023. The guidelines do not apply to any remuneration specifically resolved by the general meeting, such as remuneration to board members or share-related incentive schemes.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p><span><span><span style="color:black"><span style="font-size:9pt"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Beijer Ref is a trading group that provides customers over most of the world with a broad range of products in the fields of commercial and industrial refrigeration, as well as heating and air conditioning. Beijer Ref has an expressed mission &ndash; to provide the market with global expertise in refrigeration and air conditioning. By growing more quickly than the market, the goal is to strengthen the position as a world-leading organisation. To do this, the group works according to a strategy that is divided into five focus areas &ndash; acquisition, own manufacturing, supply chain, digitalisation and sustainability. A prerequisite for the successful implementation of Beijer Ref&rsquo;s business strategy and safeguarding of its long-term interests, including its sustainability, is that the Company is able to recruit and retain qualified personnel. The objective of Beijer Ref&rsquo;s remuneration policy for senior executives is therefore to offer competitive remuneration on market terms, in order to attract, motivate and retain competent and skilled employees. These guidelines enable the Company to offer senior executives a competitive total remuneration.

Fulfilment of criteria for payment of variable cash remuneration shall be measured during a one year period. The CEO obtains an amount corresponding to a maximum of 100% of the annual salary, and the Group Executive Management obtains an amount corresponding to a maximum of 75% of the annual salary. Variable cash remuneration shall not qualify for pension benefits. The variable cash remuneration shall be linked to predetermined, well-defined and measurable financial and non-financial criteria for the Beijer Ref Group and on group and individual level, respectively, such as growth of revenue, growth of profit and working capital development, and with regard to non-financial targets, they should be clearly linked to functional targets and/or sustainability targets. Weighting is done relatively between the different criteria based on which focus shall be given to the executive management; the primary weight is to be placed on growth of profit. The non-financial targets may amount to a maximum of 20% of the total variable cash remuneration. The criteria shall be designed so as to contribute to Beijer Ref&rsquo;s business strategy and long-term interests, including its sustainability, by for example being linked to the business strategy or promote the senior executive&rsquo;s long-term development within Beijer Ref. </span></span></span></span></span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="margin-bottom:11px;margin-top:12px"><span><span><span><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><strong><span style="font-size:10pt"><span>The subscription period in the rights issue of shares of series B in Beijer Ref AB (publ) ("Beijer Ref") ended on 16&nbsp;March 2023. The preliminary outcome shows that the rights issue has been oversubscribed. As a result of the rights issue, Beijer Ref will receive proceeds amounting to SEK&nbsp;13,946 million, before issue costs.</span></span></strong></span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom:11px"><span><span><span><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span>The preliminary outcome indicates that 126,359,340 shares of series B, corresponding to approximately 99.7&nbsp;per&nbsp;cent of the offered shares in the rights issue, have been subscribed for by exercise of subscription rights. Additionally, applications for subscription without subscription rights of 56,526,083 shares of series B, corresponding to approximately 44.6 per&nbsp;cent of the offered shares in the rights issue, have been received. In aggregate, the preliminary outcome thereby indicates that approximately 144.3 per&nbsp;cent of the rights issue has been subscribed for. The rights issue is thus fully subscribed and the underwriting commitment will not need to be utilised.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom:11px"><span><span><span><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span>As a result of the rights issue, Beijer Ref will receive proceeds amounting to SEK&nbsp;13,946 million, before issue costs.

After the rights issue, the number of shares in Beijer Ref will amount to 509,085,926, of which 27,956,160 shares of series A and 481,129,766 shares of series B.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom:11px"><span><span><span><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span>Those who have subscribed for shares without subscription rights will be allotted shares according to the principles outlined in the prospectus. As a confirmation of the allotment of new shares subscribed for without subscription rights, a contract note will be sent to subscribers on or around 21&nbsp;March 2023.

Nominee-registered shareholders will receive notice of allotment in accordance with the procedures of the nominee. Notification will only be sent to those that have been allotted shares.</span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom:11px"><span><span><span><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span>The final outcome of the rights issue is expected to be announced on 20&nbsp;March 2023.

Sales amounted to SEK 5,818 million, which is an increase of 36 per cent compared with the corresponding period the previous year.

Both of these product areas are in an expansive phase and during the quarter we invested in a build-up of stocks of critical components. All our markets in the southern hemisphere have experienced strong growth in environmentally friendly solutions in our OEM segment. During the quarter, we completed the previously announced acquisition of the Australian HVAC company AAD and HVAC Consolidated.</span></p>

During the quarter, the supply of materials, including semiconductors, improved and the price of raw materials stabilised. There are still long lead times, but we have good expectations that this will normalise in 2023.</span></p>

The transaction, which was finalised on 20 January, represents a significant milestone in Beijer Ref’s history and an important strategic step in our continued growth journey. Heritage Distribution offers an excellent platform from which we can continue to pursue consolidation. Work is now underway to integrate the company and benefit from value-creating synergies and common points of contact, such as environmentally friendly and innovative HVAC technologies.</span></p>

The ambition is to set goals and definable action to limit global warming to a maximum of 1.5 degrees. Beijer Ref is actively working to contribute to sustainable societal development and has an important role when it comes to electrification and the programme to phase out F-gases. During the quarter, we also renewed our partnership with Danfoss, which includes an increased focus on sustainability.</span></p>

Net sales totalled just over SEK 22,6 billion, which is an increase of 34 per cent compared with 2021. Organic growth was 16 per cent and, in parallel with organic growth, we have added eight new companies to the group. EBITA, excluding items affecting comparability, for the full year was SEK 2,217 million, which is an increase of 57.2 percent, and the corresponding margin was 9.8 percent.</span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom:8pt;margin-top:0pt"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:10pt">The acquisition and acquisition related costs will be financed through a bridge facility provided by Handelsbanken and Nordea amounting to approximately SEK 13.6 billion. As previously announced, the facility is intended to be repaid by proceeds from a fully underwritten rights issue of series B shares with preferential rights for existing shareholders in Beijer Ref. For purposes of authorising the Board of Directors to resolve on the rights issue, the Board of Directors calls for an Extraordinary General Meeting on 17 February 2023, and proposes that the Board of Directors shall be authorised to resolve to issue new shares of series B for issue proceeds amounting to approximately SEK 14 billion, with the purpose to (re)pay the bridge facility and finance issue related costs. To enable the rights issue, the Board of Directors further proposes changes to the Articles of Association, including that the limits for the share capital and the number of shares are adjusted. </span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom:8pt;margin-top:0pt"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:10pt">The rights issue is intended to be launched during the first half of 2023.</span><span style="background-color:#fffef9;color:#00223a;font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:10pt"> </span><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:10pt">EQT has undertaken to subscribe for its pro rata share of the rights issue, corresponding to 29.8% of the shares (excl. treasury shares). Citi, Handelsbanken and Nordea have committed to underwrite the remainder of the rights issue, subject to customary terms and conditions, by entering into a standby underwriting agreement with Beijer Ref, which commitment is envisaged to be replaced by a hard underwriting agreement upon launch of the rights issue. </span></p>

The North American market is currently undergoing a shift towards electrification and energy efficiency, accelerated by regulatory changes. Also, the growing recognition of indoor air quality and climate change impacts has increased the demand for environmentally friendly and innovative HVAC technologies, which creates a great opportunity for our combined product offering. Furthermore, the North American market is highly fragmented and Heritage Distribution offers an excellent platform from which we can continue to drive consolidation. With our collective industry awareness and proficiency, there are many significant and valuable synergies to be unlocked. We are pleased to welcome Heritage Distribution to the Beijer Ref group and look forward to continuing their successful journey.&rdquo;</span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom:8pt;margin-top:0pt"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:10pt">Alex Averitt, CEO Heritage Distribution, comments:</span></p>

Personally, I am looking forward to working with Christopher and the whole Beijer Ref team to unlock the many growth opportunities that we will have. Beijer Ref has an impressive history of successful acquisitions and strong organic growth. This agreement enhances our current position in the U.S. and is expected to generate many positive outcomes for our customers and employees, who will benefit from our expanded product portfolio and value-creating synergies. Heritage Distribution Holdings and Beijer Ref share the same decentralized business model where entrepreneurial thinking and freedom with responsibility permeating the organization.

<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:0pt"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:10pt"><strong>Rationale for the acquisition</strong></span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom:8pt;margin-top:0pt"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:10pt">The acquisition of Heritage Distribution marks Beijer Ref&rsquo;s entry into the strategically important and attractive North American market. North America represents a significant growth opportunity for Beijer Ref as it is the world&rsquo;s largest HVACR market. It is a highly fragmented market underpinned by strong secular trends and a regulatory shift towards more energy efficient and sustainable products. In addition, the ongoing market shift towards higher electrification and energy efficiency drives increased underlying demand.</span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom:8pt;margin-top:0pt"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:10pt">Heritage Distribution is a leading HVACR distributor in the South/South East region of the U.S. which is one of the most attractive regions for HVACR in North America. The region experiences a warm climate entailing high frequency replacement cycles that are expected to accelerate due to climate change and higher energy efficiency demands.</span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom:8pt;margin-top:0pt"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:10pt">Heritage Distribution is an ideal platform with an experienced management team that will continue to drive consolidation in the highly fragmented North American market. The acquisition also enables a significant opportunity to cross-sell Beijer Ref&rsquo;s green refrigeration OEM product offering. Moreover, Beijer Ref&rsquo;s strong relationships with global OEM suppliers is expected to lead to scale benefits and a broader product offering.</span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom:8pt;margin-top:0pt"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:10pt">In addition, the acquisition is expected to enhance Beijer Ref&rsquo;s organic growth profile. Heritage Distribution had a compound annual organic sales growth rate of approximately 9% over the period 2012-2021. Beijer Ref expects the acquisition of Heritage Distribution to be accretive to Beijer Ref&rsquo;s EBITDA margin and organic sales growth. For the twelve months ended September 30, 2022, and on a pro forma basis including acquisitions made by Heritage Distribution during 2022, Heritage Distribution had an adjusted EBITDA margin of 15%, compared to Beijer Ref&rsquo;s EBITDA margin of 12% over the same period.</span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:0pt"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:10pt"><strong>Financing of the acquisition</strong></span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom:8pt;margin-top:0pt"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:10pt">The acquisition will be financed through a bridge facility provided by Handelsbanken and Nordea.</span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom:8pt;margin-top:0pt"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:10pt">To repay the bridge facility, Beijer Ref intends to carry out a rights issue of class B shares amounting to approximately SEK 14 billion with preferential rights for existing shareholders in Beijer Ref during the first half of 2023, after closing of the acquisition. </span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom:8pt;margin-top:0pt"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:10pt">The shareholders EQT, Joen Magnusson and Per Bertland, together controlling 53.2% of the votes outstanding</span><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:6.67pt;vertical-align:super">8</span><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:10pt">, have undertaken to vote in favor of the implementation of the rights issue at an extraordinary general meeting. EQT has also undertaken to subscribe for its pro rata share of the rights issue, corresponding to 29.8% of the shares</span><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">in the rights issue<sup>9</sup></span></span><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:10pt">. Citi, Handelsbanken and Nordea have committed to underwrite the remaining 70.2% of the rights issue by entering into a so called standby underwriting agreement, subject to customary terms and conditions.</span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom:8pt;margin-top:0pt"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:10pt">A detailed time plan and the forms for the implementation of the rights issue will be announced at a later stage.</span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:0pt"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:10pt">The Extraordinary General Meeting (the &ldquo;</span><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:10pt"><strong>EGM</strong></span><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:10pt">&rdquo;) of Beijer Ref AB (publ) (&ldquo;</span><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:10pt"><strong>Beijer Ref</strong></span><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:10pt">&rdquo;) today made the following resolutions. </span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:0pt"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:11pt">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:0pt"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:10pt"><em>Board of Directors and fees</em></span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:0pt"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:10pt">The Meeting resolved, in accordance with the Nomination Committee&rsquo;s proposal, to increase the Board of Directors with one member through new election of Nathalie Delbreuve as Board member. It was resolved that Board fees according to the Annual General Meeting&rsquo;s resolution, shall continue to apply. Fees (including fees for committee work) are to be paid to the incoming Board member </span><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:10pt"><em>pro rata</em></span><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:10pt"> in relation to the Board member&rsquo;s actual duty period.</span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:0pt"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:10pt">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:0pt"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:10pt"><em>Amendment of the Articles of Association</em></span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:0pt"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:10pt">The Meeting resolved, in accordance with the Board of Directors&rsquo; proposal, to amend the limits for the minimum and maximum share capital in the articles of association so that the company&rsquo;s share capital shall be not less than SEK 250,000,000 and not more than SEK 500,000,000 and the limits for the minimum and maximum number of shares in the articles of association so that the number of shares shall be not less than 250,000,000 and not more than 500,000,000.</span></p>

<h2 style="font-size:10pt;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:3pt"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:11pt;font-weight:normal"><em>Authorisation for the Board to resolve on a new share issue</em></span></h2>

<p style="margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:0pt"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:10pt">The Meeting resolved, in accordance with the Board of Directors&rsquo; proposal, to re-establish and replace the unutilised authorisation resolved by the Annual General Meeting in 2022 and thus authorise the Board of Directors to, on one or more occasions during the period up to the next Annual General Meeting, resolve on issue of a maximum of 38,230,407 new shares, corresponding to 10 per cent of the company&rsquo;s total number of shares. The share issue may be with or without deviation from the shareholders&rsquo; preferential rights, by payment in cash, by contribution in kind or by set-off. The purpose of the authorisation and the reason for the deviation from the shareholders&rsquo; preferential right is to pursue the company&#039;s acquisition strategy by enabling acquisitions by payment in Beijer Ref shares (contribution in kind) or flexibility in the financing of acquisitions. The share issue price shall be determined in accordance with market conditions, which may include customary discounts. Other terms may be resolved by the Board of Directors.</span></p>

<p style="font-size:11pt;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:0pt"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:10pt">&nbsp;</span></p>

<p style="font-size:11pt;margin-bottom:0pt;margin-top:0pt"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:10pt">Minutes with complete resolutions from the Meeting will be made available on the company&rsquo;s website, </span><a href="http://www.beijerref.com" style="text-decoration:none"><span style="color:#0563c1;font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:10pt"><u>www.beijerref.com</u></span></a><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:10pt"> no later than 24 November 2022. </span></p>

The previous press release contained an incorrect reference to the EU Market Abuse Regulation. The information concerning the change of CFO is not considered inside information and the reference to MAR has been removed.</span></span></em></p><p style="margin-bottom:11px;margin-top:12px"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><strong><span style="background-color:white"><span style="color:black">Beijer Ref and Ulf Berghult, Executive Vice President (EVP) and CFO, have mutually agreed that Ulf will transition out of the company in the next 6 months.

His strong leadership and extensive knowledge have been instrumental in creating a solid group finance team and structure that will be able to support further growth of the company. Furthermore, Ulf’s guidance through Beijer Ref’s prospectus, in connection with the acquisition of Heritage Distribution, as well as the financing of our entry into the US market has been of great importance. As Beijer Ref is now facing a new chapter, accelerating both its growth and its global presence, we have mutually agreed that this is a good opportunity for Ulf to scale down and to let a new long-term CFO take over the journey and the continued execution of Beijer Ref’s strategy.”</span></span></span></span></p>

He holds valuable experience from working in multinational companies, operating abroad and in Sweden, where he has led several finance functions - driving and executing business strategies. Joel’s operating skills and leadership abilities will make him an important member of our management team and I am confident that Beijer Ref’s growth journey will continue across all functions.”</span></span></span></span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="margin-bottom:11px;margin-top:12px"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><strong>Beijer Ref has signed an agreement to acquire the assets of AMSCO Supply (&ldquo;AMSCO&rdquo;), a North American wholesale HVAC distributor. The company serves contractors in the Midwest and Southwest United States including Oklahoma, Kansas, Missouri and Texas &ndash; territories adjacent to Beijer Ref&rsquo;s current holdings in the US. AMSCO has annual sales of approximately SEK 500 million.</strong></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom:11px;text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Founded in 1974 and headquartered in Tulsa, Oklahoma, AMSCO Supply is a family-owned company with more than 45 years of experience. The AMSCO team comprises skilled professionals committed to providing solutions for different HVAC market segments, such as residential add-on replacements and commercial projects. The company has strong alignment with Beijer Ref&rsquo;s key suppliers in the US region.</span></span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom:11px;text-align:justify"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">AMSCO will continue to operate under its own brand, in both distribution and marketing. The existing management will roll-over investment into Beijer Ref&rsquo;s US platform and continue to run the business. The acquisition is expected to have a minor positive impact on the group&rsquo;s result and position. AMSCO Supply employs approximately 50 people.</span></span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom:11px"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Christopher Norbye, CEO Beijer Ref, comments:<br>
&ldquo;We are pleased to welcome AMSCO Supply to the Beijer Ref Group. The acquisition is consistent with our overall strategy, driving increased commercial synergies and operational efficiencies within the US market. Furthermore, AMSCO Supply offers extensive expertise and knowledge and will be a valuable complement to our existing platform in the US as we continue to expand our geographical footprint and drive growth.&rdquo;</span></span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="margin-bottom:11px;margin-top:12px"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">During the year, a tax restructuring took place in the Beijer Ref US operations, which has resulted in an increase in the tax base of the US operations by an additional approximately MUSD 235. Together with the now expanded tax base, the payable tax in the US operations is expected to be positively impacted by approximately MUSD 200 over a 15-year period.The lower payable tax will be recognized on an ongoing basis as deferred tax liability, which is why profit in the coming years will not be affected. </span></span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom:11px"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">The tax restructuring also means that a currently recognized deferred tax liability of approximately MUSD 40.6 (corresponding to approximately MSEK 440) will be eliminated with a corresponding positive impact on earnings in the fourth quarter and profit for the year 2023. The positive impact on earnings is a one-off effect and does not correspond to a liquidity event.&nbsp; </span></span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom:11px"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">In connection with this, the fourth quarter will be impacted by a non-recurring cost of approximately MSEK 60 – mainly attributable to consultancy costs, to establish a tax base for the tax restructuring in the Americas and non-recurring costs related to structural changes centrally and within the APAC and EMEA organization.</span></span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><strong>The new three-year agreement covers the production and distribution of sustainable refrigeration solutions on a global scale</strong></h2>
October 2023 - Embraco, a global provider of refrigeration technology and a portfolio brand of Nidec Global Appliance, and Beijer Ref, a leading wholesaler of cooling technologies and air conditioning, announced a new three-year partnership renewal. First established in 2015, the long-lasting alliance aims to strengthen their position in the wholesaling business and boost the distribution of a complete refrigeration portfolio at a global level.

Embraco’s brand solutions for commercial and residential refrigeration are sold in 90 countries  and the Beijer Ref Group has 150+ subsidiaries and 500+ branches spread across 45 countries. “Since the beginning of the agreement, Embraco and Beijer Ref have had expressive business growth, across all the regions they cover. With the partnership renewal, it will be possible to keep  combining  our high quality, sustainable refrigeration solutions with the advantage of a distributor with a high level of capillarity”, said Daniel Campos, Commercial Appliances Vice President at Nidec Global Appliance.

Christopher Norbye, CEO Beijer Ref, comments:

”We are pleased to renew our long-established endeavor and expertise with Embraco and satisfied with the agreement's growing potential. This fruitful teamwork makes it possible to fortify our position worldwide and provide refrigeration technicians, installers and small OEMs with an extensive set of products.”

The most recent action of both companies is the widening offer of a complete portfolio of condensing units, including unhoused, housed and silenced options for installers and manufacturers, which can be used in indoor contexts such as supermarkets and professional kitchens and outdoor ones, such as gas stations.

“Our task ahead is to expand our product offer and consolidate our leadership as a company  which foresees the trends of the refrigeration market, while offering our customers the most complete product portfolio and serving them best.", Daniel Campos concluded.”]]></content:encoded>

Sales during the quarter amounted to SEK 7,627 million, which is an increase of 31 per cent compared with the corresponding period the previous year. EBITA before items affecting comparability amounted to SEK 721 million, which is an increase of 26 per cent compared to the corresponding period the previous year. The EBITA margin, excluding items affecting comparability, was 9.5 per cent compared with 9.8 per cent the previous year. There was a negative effect on EBITA during the quarter caused by high acquisition-related costs of approximately SEK 25 million<span style="color: black">,</span>”<span style="color: black"> says CEO <span style="color: black">Christopher Norbye.</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-right:36px"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:9pt"><span style="vertical-align:middle">Allocated performance share rights are subject to vesting during the term of the Program, with duration up to and including the date of Beijer Ref’s annual general meeting 2026 and annual general meeting 2027, respectively. Allocated shares, together with any dividend compensation as described below, will be distributed to the participant after the annual general meeting 2026 (relating to the financial years 2024 and 2025 and the measurement period 2024–2025) and after the annual general meeting 2027 (relating to the financial year 2026 and the measurement period 2024–2026). </span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-right:36px"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:9pt"><span style="vertical-align:middle">The number of allocated performance share rights that may be vested depends on the growth of profit per share based on established growth targets for each financial year. Profit per share for a given financial year refer to profit per share after dilution excluding items affecting comparability. Prior to the start of the Investment Period, the board of directors will decide on performance targets as described above. This takes place in the form of a minimum target level and a stretch target level for the profit per share, relating to (i) each of the financial years 2024, 2025 and 2026, (ii) a minimum target level and stretch target level for profit per share for the period 2024–2025 (based on the targets per financial year), and (iii) a minimum target level and stretch target level for profit per share for the entire period 2024–2026 (based on the targets per financial year).</span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-right:36px"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:9pt"><span style="vertical-align:middle">If the minimum target level for any measurement period is not reached, no performance share rights shall be vested. If the stretch target level for a financial year is reached, one third of the total number of allocated performance share rights shall be vested. If the stretch target level for the measurement period 2024–2025 is reached, two thirds of the total number of allocated performance share rights shall be vested. If the stretch target level for the entire measurement period 2024–2026 is achieved, the entire number of allocated performance share rights shall be vested. If the outcome falls between the minimum and stretch target level in any case, the profit shall be calculated linearly. The participant’s individual vesting of allocated performance share rights is thereby determined as the highest of (i) the outcome for each individual financial year 2024 and 2025 compared to the entire measurement period 2024–2025, and (ii) in addition, the outcome for the financial year 2026 compared to the entire measurement period 2024–2026, minus the vesting paid out for the financial years 2024–2025.</span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-right:36px"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:9pt"><span style="vertical-align:middle">Each performance share right vested entitles the participant to receive allotment and payment of one share of series B in Beijer Ref, free of charge. The number of vested performance share rights and the corresponding allotment of shares is determined by the board of directors in connection with the company’s year-end report for 2025 and 2026, respectively, based on the terms and conditions of the Program, but subject to continued vesting up to and including the annual general meeting 2026 and annual general meeting 2027, respectively. In addition, a dividend compensation is received corresponding to the share dividend during respective vesting period on the allotted number of shares up to and including the time of payment. The company shall have the right to pay the dividend compensation in cash or in shares of series B, where the number of shares is determined based on the closing price during the first day the share is traded without the right to (first) dividend in 2025, 2026 and 2027, respectively.</span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-right:36px"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:9pt"><span style="vertical-align:middle">The reason why the vesting period is partly less than three years is to facilitate motivation for employees to invest or reinvest from previous LTI-programs and to create strong incentives for the performance targets for the financial years 2024 and 2025 and thereby achieve a high level of participation.</span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-right:36px"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:9pt"><span style="vertical-align:middle">A condition for receiving allotment and payment of shares is that the Participant has retained all of his/her Investment Shares up to and including the annual general meeting 2026 and the annual general meeting 2027, respectively, and at such dates remains employed by the Group and has not terminated his/her employment (with customary exceptions).</span></span></span></p>

The board of directors shall also be entitled to make other reasonable adjustments if there are significant changes in the Group’s operations including M&amp;A that would entail that the decided terms and conditions under LTI 2024 are no longer appropriate. Such adjustments also include the right for the board of directors to resolve on a reduction of the allocation of shares if, taking into account Beijer Ref’s results and financial position, the Group’s development in general and the conditions on the stock market, the allocation would be clearly unreasonable.</span></span></span></p>

The calculation has been carried out with the following assumptions: (i) a share price for Beijer Ref’s B-shares of SEK&nbsp;135.10 upon implementation of the program (corresponding to the closing price on 18 March 2024), (ii) an annual share price increase for Beijer Ref’s B-share of 10 per cent per year, (iii) an annual dividend based on the consensus estimate 2024–2026, (iv) full participation in the program and (v) average social security contributions of 25 per cent. Furthermore, assuming an average achievement of the performance targets of 50 per cent and an annual employee turnover of 10 per cent, this entails an estimated accounting cost for LTI 2024 of approximately SEK 27.7 million, of which approximately SEK 8.8 million relates to social security contributions. At maximum fulfillment of the performance targets and an annual share price increase of 20 per cent, the corresponding cost is approximately SEK 55.4 million, of which SEK 21.2 million relates to social security contributions. In the scenarios described, LTI 2024 would affect profit per share by SEK -0.02 and SEK -0.04 per share, respectively on pro forma basis for 2023. </span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-right:36px"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:9pt"><span style="vertical-align:middle">In order to ensure Beijer Ref’s delivery of shares to participants in both LTI 2024 and any future incentive programs, as well as to secure the payment of future social security contributions attributable to the delivery of shares, the board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to authorise the board of directors to acquire a maximum of 550,000 shares of series B in the company before the annual general meeting 2025. Acquisitions shall take place at Nasdaq Stockholm in accordance with Nasdaq Stockholm’s rulebook at a price within the price range registered at any time. Acquisitions shall be paid for in cash and may take place on one or several occasions.</span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-right:36px"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:9pt"><span style="vertical-align:middle">In the view of LTI 2024, the board of directors proposes that the annual general meeting resolves to transfer shares in Beijer Ref as follows. A maximum of 550,000 B-shares may be transferred. The right to acquire B-shares shall, with deviation from the preferential rights of the shareholders, be granted to the persons participating in LTI 2024, with the right for each participant to acquire a maximum number of shares that follows from the terms and conditions of LTI 2024. Transfer of B-shares to participants in LTI 2024 shall be made free of charge at the time and on the terms and conditions of LTI 2024 that participants in LTI 2024 are entitled to be allotted shares. The number of shares that may be transferred shall be recalculated in the event of an intervening bonus issue, share split, rights issue and similar corporate actions.</span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-right:36px"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:9pt"><span style="vertical-align:middle">The transfer of own shares is part of the proposed LTI 2024 and the board of directors considers it to be beneficial to the company and the shareholders that participants in the Program are offered the opportunity to become shareholders in the company under the terms and conditions of LTI 2024. </span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-right:36px"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:9pt"><span style="vertical-align:middle">Since LTI 2024 is initially not expected to give rise to a need for cash settlement or payment of social security contributions, the board of directors has decided not to propose to the annual general meeting 2024 to resolve on transfers of own shares on a regulated market to secure such payments in terms of liquidity. However, before any transfers of Beijer Ref shares take place to participants in LTI 2024, the board of directors may propose to a later general meeting to resolve that transfers may be made of own shares on a regulated market to secure such payments.</span></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-right:36px"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><span style="font-size:9pt"><span style="vertical-align:middle">The board of directors proposes that the general meeting, in the event that a sufficient majority according to item (B) above cannot be met, resolves to hedge the financial exposure that LTI 2024 is expected to entail by Beijer Ref being able to enter into a so-called share swap agreement with third party on market terms, whereby the third party in its own name shall be able to acquire and transfer shares in Beijer Ref to the participants.</span></span></span></p>

LTI 2024 has been prepared by the remuneration committee and discussed at board meetings.</span></span></span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="margin-bottom:11px;margin-top:12px"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><strong>Beijer Ref has signed an agreement to acquire Young Supply, a North American distributor of commercial refrigeration and HVAC with headquarters in Detroit, Michigan. The company serves contractors in the Midwest United States, including Michigan and Ohio – territories adjacent to Beijer Ref’s current holdings in the United States. Young Supply has annual sales of approximately SEK 1.4 billion with 18 branches.</strong></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom:11px"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Young Supply is a family-owned company that was founded in 1935. With over 85 years of experience, Young Supply provides an experienced and professional team dedicated to offering solutions in commercial refrigeration and HVAC, primarily focusing on the aftermarket for both residential and commercial projects. The company has strong alignment with Beijer Ref’s key suppliers in the U.S. region.</span></span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom:11px"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Young Supply will continue to operate under its existing brand, both in distribution and marketing. The existing management will roll-over investment into Beijer Ref’s U.S. platform and continue to run the business. The acquisition is expected to have a minor positive impact on the group’s result. Young Supply employs approximately 200 people.</span></span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom:11px"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Christopher Norbye, CEO Beijer Ref, comments:</span></span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom:11px"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">“We are pleased to welcome Young Supply to the Beijer Ref group. The company offers comprehensive expertise and knowledge, primarily in commercial refrigeration, which will be an important addition to Beijer Ref’s existing platform in the United States. With our collective industry knowledge, new opportunities arise to create meaningful synergies that support the long-term goals of the business. The acquisition aligns with our overall acquisition strategy and we look forward to continuing to drive growth and develop the company together with the existing owners.”</span></span></p>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p style="margin-bottom:11px;margin-top:12px"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif"><strong>Beijer Ref has signed an agreement to acquire Young Supply, a North American distributor of commercial refrigeration and HVAC with headquarters in Detroit, Michigan. The company serves contractors in the Midwest United States, including Michigan and Ohio – territories adjacent to Beijer Ref’s current holdings in the United States. Young Supply has annual sales of approximately SEK 1.4 billion with 18 branches.</strong></span></span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom:11px"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Young Supply is a family-owned company that was founded in 1935. With over 85 years of experience, Young Supply provides an experienced and professional team dedicated to offering solutions in commercial refrigeration and HVAC, primarily focusing on the aftermarket for both residential and commercial projects. The company has strong alignment with Beijer Ref’s key suppliers in the U.S. region.</span></span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom:11px"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Young Supply will continue to operate under its existing brand, both in distribution and marketing. The existing management will roll-over investment into Beijer Ref’s U.S. platform and continue to run the business. The acquisition is expected to have a minor positive impact on the group’s result. Young Supply employs approximately 200 people.</span></span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom:11px"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">Christopher Norbye, CEO Beijer Ref, comments:</span></span></p>

<p style="margin-bottom:11px"><span style="font-size:10pt"><span style="font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif">“We are pleased to welcome Young Supply to the Beijer Ref group. The company offers comprehensive expertise and knowledge, primarily in commercial refrigeration, which will be an important addition to Beijer Ref’s existing platform in the United States. With our collective industry knowledge, new opportunities arise to create meaningful synergies that support the long-term goals of the business. The acquisition aligns with our overall acquisition strategy and we look forward to continuing to drive growth and develop the company together with the existing owners.”</span></span></p>

EBITA amounted to SEK 733 million, which is an increase of 4 per cent compared with the same period last year. The EBITA margin was in line with the same period last year and amounted to 9.5 per cent. The quarter was affected by high comparative figures and two fewer trading days. Organic sales amounted to -4 per cent (+15%), mainly related to negative growth in HVAC of 7 per cent (+17%). Despite high comparative figures, OEM reported good organic growth of 9 per cent (+24%). Commercial and industrial refrigeration had a slight negative organic growth of 3 per cent (+10%). Towards the end of the quarter, we noted a normalization of the high comparative figures. A controlled inventory build-up, adapted to seasonal variations, contributed to a strong operational cash flow of SEK 582 million,” says CEO Christopher Norbye.</span></span></p>

Currently, approximately 95 participants in the program hold call options corresponding to 1,623,600 underlying shares of series B in Beijer Ref at an exercise price of SEK 150.40 per share.
